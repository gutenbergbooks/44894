<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>In the course of the last ten or twelve years there has
been a very marked development of interest in local
history, and with it a desire not merely to "know more
about the past" but a desire to appreciate intelligently
the real value of those things, still to be seen, which
speak of the gradual building up of the social life of
the Nation, which rightly handled will play an important
part in the work of reconstruction pressing upon
us now, with its enormous difficulties and anxieties.</p>

<p>Much has been done in schools of all grades to utilize
the material at hand&mdash;the things which can be seen in
the locality&mdash;as an educational medium, opening out
great possibilities for the development of curiosity, interest,
personality, and power of initiative on the part
of the children which, though it may not seem to yield
any immediate results which can be appraised by examination
methods on the lines of any "Syllabus", are
"neither barren nor unfruitful".</p>

<p>Just now there are a number of schemes in the air
for the institution of "Regional Survey" in schools,
and a tendency amongst enthusiasts to get it put into
school time-tables as a Syllabus Subject. However
admirable the intention may be, and is, it is not as a
Subject, but rather as a method in education, that its
real value lies. "Regional Study" embraces so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
subjects and they cannot be enterprised all at once,
either by children or by anybody else.</p>

<p>This little book is intended to be suggestive, to stimulate
interest and an intelligent curiosity, but it may
serve as a foundation for conversational or more formal
lessons and investigations under the teacher's direction,
as his personal predilection, opportunities, taste, and
judgment shall determine.</p>

<p>In the work of "Regional Study", where carried on
with discrimination and with a commonsense apprehension
of "relative values" it may be truly said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p4 title2">SOCIAL<br />
LIFE IN ENGLAND</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
Introduction</h2>

<p>A little boy, who had been born in a log-cabin in the
backwoods of Canada, was taken by his father, when
he was about eight years old, to the nearest settlement,
for the first time in his life. The little fellow had never
till then seen any other house than that in which he
had been born, for the settlement was many miles away.
"Father," he said, "what makes all the houses come
together?"</p>

<p>Now that sounds a very strange and foolish question
to ask; but it is by no means as foolish a question as
it seems. Here, in England, there are towns and
villages dotted about all over the country. Some of
them are near the sea, on some big bay or inlet; others
stand a little farther inland, on the banks of tidal rivers;
others are far away from the sea, in sheltered valleys
or on the sunny slopes of hills; some stand in the
midst of broad fertile plains, while others are on the
verge of bleak lonely moorlands. What has made
all the houses in these towns and villages come together
in these particular spots? There must be a reason in
every case why a particular spot should have been
chosen in the first instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
In trying to find an answer to this question with
reference to any town or village in our country we
have to go back, far back, into the past. We may
have to go back to ages long before there was any
written history. As we go back step by step into the
past we learn much of the people who have lived before
us&mdash;of their ways and their doings, and of the part
they played in the life and work of the country.</p>

<p>The little Canadian boy's question can be asked
about every town and village in the land. There are
no two places exactly alike; each one has its own
history, which, however simple it may be, is quite
worth knowing. The busy manufacturing town, with
its tens and hundreds of thousands of people, where
all is movement and bustle, has its history; and the
lonely country village, where everybody knows everybody
else, has often a history even more interesting
than that of the big town&mdash;if we only knew what to
look for, and where to look for it.</p>

<p>One summer day, years ago, a party of tourists was
climbing Helvellyn. One of the party was an elderly
gentleman, who was particularly active, and anxious
to get to the top. After several hours' stiff climbing
the party reached the summit; and there, spread out
before them, was a lovely view of hills and dales, of
mountains and lakes. Most of the party gazed upon
this fair scene in quiet enjoyment; but our old gentleman,
as soon as he had recovered his breath, and
mopped his red face with his pocket-handkerchief, gave
one look round, and then said in a grieved tone:
"Is that all? Nothing to see! Wish I hadn't come."</p>

<p>He saw nothing interesting, because he did not know
what to look for, and he might just as well have
stopped at the bottom. He came to see nothing, <em>and
he saw it</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
Men who lived in Caves and Pits</h2>

<p>Man is a very ancient creature. It is a curious fact
that we have learned most of what we know about the
earliest men from the rubbish which they have left
behind them. Even nowadays, in this twentieth century,
without knowing much about a boy personally,
we can tell a good deal about his habits from the
treasures he turns out of his pockets. Hard-hearted
mothers and teachers call these treasures rubbish, but
the contents of a lad's pockets are a pretty sure indication
of the boy's tastes, and in what things he is
interested.</p>

<p>The earliest traces of the existence of man in our
part of the world are found in some places which are
now many feet above the level of the sea. There, in
the gravel, are the roughly-chipped stone tools and
weapons which those early men used, tools which they
lost or threw away. Almost every other trace has
quite disappeared. Remains belonging to the same
period have been noticed in caves in various parts of
the world.</p>

<p>The illustration on p. 5 shows two of these very early
stone weapons. You will find collections of these, and
also of later weapons, in any good museum. These
earliest sorts are usually labelled "Palæolithic Stone
Implements". The curator of such a museum, we may
almost certainly say, would be willing to help you to
see the specimens which he has under his care, and
you would learn more about them in that way than
by just glancing at a picture.</p>

<p>Here, in Britain, caves have been found where these
early men have left their stone implements and remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of their rubbish. Some of the best known of such
cave-dwellings in Britain are near Denbigh and St.
Asaph in North Wales, at Uphill in Somersetshire, at
King's Car and Victoria Cave near Settle, at Robin
Hood's Cave and Pinhole in Derbyshire, in Pembrokeshire,
in King Arthur's Cave in Monmouthshire, at
Durdham Down near Bristol, near Oban, and in the
gravels in the valleys of the Rivers Trent, Nore, and
Dove, in the Irish River Blackwater, near Caithness,
and in a good many other places.</p>

<p>So, you see, the remains of these early men cover
a pretty wide area. In thinking of the life of those
early days we must remember that the aspect of Britain
was very different then from what it is now, for in that
far-back time these islands were a part of the Continent
of Europe, and the North Sea and English Channel
were just valleys, with rivers flowing through them,
tributaries of the Rhine. There were no insurmountable
obstacles to cross between the Continent and these
regions, and animals and early man gradually roamed
into this part of the world. Geology teaches us a
good deal concerning the changes the surface of the
ground has undergone. The land was very much higher
than it is now&mdash;Snowdon, for instance, was at least six
hundred feet higher then&mdash;and the climate was very
much colder. That race of men, apparently, has quite
died out. In the course of ages rivers and seas have
flowed over the places where these stone tools had been
dropped, and, year after year throughout the ages, the
drift brought down by the rivers covered them inch by
inch and foot by foot. Great changes have taken place
in the surface of the land, some suddenly, but most of
them very, very slowly. The land has risen, and sunk
again, and long, long ages of sunshine and storm, of
ice and snow, of stormy wind and tempest, have altered
the surface of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Those very ancient men, who lived in the Early
Stone Age, are called Cave-dwellers, because they
lived apparently in caves, and River-drift Men and
Lake-dwellers, because the roughly chipped tools are
found in the <em>drift</em> of various rivers and lakes.</p>

<p>The Cave-man's weapons and tools were made of
chipped flint, which he found broken on the surface of
the ground, and these he chipped into shape. They are
usually more or less oval, sometimes roughly in the
form of a spear-head. Others are borers, or awls, for
piercing holes in skins. For rougher work he had
hammer-stones, with flat edges, and sharp bits of stone
for scrapers. Amongst many other places where these
relics have been found in considerable numbers is the
Thames valley. They are met with in the higher
gravels, on levels now many feet higher than they were
in the Cave-man's day, for the surface has risen considerably;
and we conclude that there must have been
a good many of these people in that neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
The Pit-dwellers</h2>

<p>Other remains, not so ancient as these oldest stone
implements but still very ancient, are found nearer the
surface than the remains of the River-drift Men. They
are the remains of people who, like the Drift-men, knew
nothing of metals; and they, too, used stone weapons
and tools, but these were now better made. They had
learned to shape and finish their tools by rubbing,
grinding, and polishing them, and they were a much
more advanced race of men than the Cave-or Drift-men.
These later men, Neolithic Men, did not depend upon
the broken and chipped flints which they found lying
about on the surface, but discovered that it was better to
dig up whole flints, and to select those which were best
suited for their purpose, grinding them into the shapes
which they wanted, and then polishing them into more
shapely and finished weapons.</p>

<p>For the most part we have to go to somewhat desolate
parts of England to find traces of them now. In fact
those traces would long ago have disappeared had they
not been in places which were so wild and difficult to get
at that it was not worth any man's while to cultivate
them. The spade and the plough would very soon
remove all traces of them. In fact, the plough <em>has</em>
removed many traces of these ancient men, and most of
the specimens of their tools and weapons, which you can
see in museums, were found by men whilst employed in
ploughing and preparing the land for crops.</p>

<p>You must not suppose that we can fix a date when
these men first appeared, as we can fix an exact date for
the landing of Julius Cæsar, or the sealing of Magna
Carta. Neither can we say for how many centuries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
they occupied land in what we now call Britain. It was
a long period, at any rate, and during that time their
manners and their customs changed very, very slowly.</p>

<p>The lowest forms of savage life seem very much alike
all the world over. Savages are hunters, and do not as
a rule cultivate the soil. Now hunters must follow their
prey from place to place, so that we should expect these
early men to have no settled homes. But even the
earliest Pit-men had advanced beyond this lowest
stage, for they had flocks and herds, and dogs. They
found out that they could tame some of the animals
which they came across, and that they could use them in
various ways which the earlier men had not thought of.
They need not always go a-hunting for their food, and
they could have a supply at hand if they looked after it.
They discovered that they had a use for the wool and
the milk which these animals yielded, and so they
developed into being a pastoral people, owning flocks
and herds. Then, too, they hit upon the art of making
rough pottery from clay, shaping the various vessels
which they wanted by hand, and baking them in a fire
to harden them. It seems that they found out a way to
spin thread from the wool, and also discovered how to
weave it into a kind of rough cloth, although they used
skins for garments. No doubt these folk hunted as well;
but they were mainly a pastoral people, and at first did
not till the soil. Races of men who did not till the soil
are called Non-Aryan. They chose for their settlements
the tops of hills, and avoided the narrow valleys and low-lying
lands.</p>

<p>The Pit-dwellers are so called from the simple fact
that they had their homes in pits&mdash;not, however, dug
anywhere and anyhow. The hole in the ground is the
simplest notion of a house. When in your summer holiday
by the sea you see the little boys and girls digging
deep holes in the sand to make "houses", they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
doing in play what the early Pit-dwellers did in real
earnest.</p>

<p>The pits were usually some six or eight feet in diameter,
and they probably had cone-shaped roofs, formed
by poles tied together and covered with peat. In the
centre of the hut was the hearth, which was made of flints
carefully placed together. The hut would hold two or
three people, and the fire on the hearth was its most
important feature. The hut in the centre of the group
belonged to the head of the family, and other huts were
ranged round it.</p>

<p>Surrounding the group was an earthen rampart for
further protection, and these earthworks can still be
traced in many parts of the country. The huts have
gone, of course, and all that can be seen in most cases
now is a number of circular patches in the turf, slightly
hollowed. People living in the neighbourhood will
very likely speak of them as "fairy rings". It is from
a careful examination of these hollows that learned men
have been able to gather much information concerning
the habits of these Pit-dwellers.</p>

<p>We English folk speak proudly of "hearth and
home"; they are the centre of our social life, and the
idea has come down to us through all these long, long
ages. The hearth and the fire upon it was the centre of
the life of these men, and the head of a family was also
its priest.</p>

<p>Some of the best known of these pit-dwellings are
found near Brighthampton, in Oxfordshire; at Worlebury,
near Weston-super-Mare; and along the Cotswolds,
looking over the Severn valley; and at Hurstbourne,
in Hampshire.</p>

<p>At this last place "nine of these early habitations were
discovered, some of which were roughly pitched with
flint-stones, and had passages leading into the pit. A
few flints irregularly placed, together with wood ashes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
showed the position of the hearths, where cooking operations
had been carried on. The sloping entrance passages
are peculiar and almost unique in England, though
several have been met with in France."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>In the course of time this race seems to have learned
something in the way of cultivating the ground. The
hill-tops, where they built their huts, were only suited
for their cattle, and in order to find soil which they could
till they had to go outside their earthwork, and some
distance down the hill-slope. By their way of digging
the ground, they gradually, in the course of many years,
carved broad terraces, one below the other, on the hill-sides.
There are some very marked traces of such
terraces still to be seen near Hitchin and Luton.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But Pit-dwellings were not the only habitations.
There were Lake-dwellings. One was found in the
year 1892, near Glastonbury, where sixty circular
mounds were noted, each the remains of a Lake-dwelling,
in an area of three acres. There is another
at Hedsor, in Buckinghamshire; and such Lake-dwellings,
of much later periods, have been found in
other parts of the world, and are met with yet in some
parts of South America on the big rivers there; in the
Island of Borneo, in the Caroline Islands, and on the
Gold Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>These dwelling-places of the Lake-dwellers were set
up on sharpened stakes, or piles, driven into the bed of
the lake or river. On these piles a platform was laid,
upon which a wooden hut of wattle and daub was built,
and a rough kind of bridge connected the dwelling with
the shore.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In the course of time&mdash;how long ago it is still quite impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to say&mdash;a race of men, more advanced than these
early Pit-dwellers, found their way to this part of the
world. They were more civilized, and were Aryans;
that is, they were cultivators of the soil. You may be
pretty sure that fighting took place between the two
races.</p>

<p>The newer race preferred to make their settlements
near running streams. In the middle of each settlement
there would be an open space, or meeting-ground,
usually a small hill or a mound, round which their huts
were built. Beyond this was the garden-ground, then
the ground where the grain was grown, and beyond that
the grazing-lands. These men began cultivating at the
bottom of the hill-sides and valleys, and, as they required
more ground, they would advance higher up the slopes.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Lake-dwelling</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Gradually to this race came the knowledge of metals,
and at that point we reach the Bronze Age. Although
polished stone implements were still in use, men had
begun to make spear-heads, chisels, and daggers of
bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin. What
a great discovery that was, and how we should like to
know how the discovery came to be made! It shows a
vast advance in intelligence, power of observation, and
perseverance in
making experiments.
This advance
gradually
led them on to the
discovery of the
tougher qualities
of iron, and how
to "get at it",
and to make use
of it. Thus we
reach the Iron
Age.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
Earthworks, Mounds, Barrows, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>There are still remaining, in many parts of the country,
curious mounds and stones. We can say very little
about them here; for, though learned men have discovered
much, there is still a good deal to be explained
concerning them. Old-world stories put most of these
strange objects down to the work of witches, fairies, or
giants; some ascribe them to the Romans, or to Oliver
Cromwell, others even to the devil. But most of them
really belong to this period of which we are speaking&mdash;the
very early part of our history, of which there is no
written record.</p>

<p>Earthworks are of many kinds, but the very earliest
are usually found on hill-tops. There are some which
enclose considerable spaces of ground, bounded by an
earthen rampart, with a ditch outside. Sometimes there
are two such ramparts. Frequently they are spoken of
as British Towns or British Camps. They appear to
have been enclosures into which the cattle were driven
in time of danger, and in which a whole tribe could take
refuge and hold out against their enemies.</p>

<p>Then there are big mounds or heaps, called Barrows.
All over the world, not only in Europe, but in northern
Asia, in India, and in America, burial-mounds of various
sizes have been met with. Some of these are oval in
shape, and are called Long Barrows; others are round,
and are called Round Barrows. The Long Barrows are
thought to be the older kind, and were apparently the
burial-places of great leaders. The Round Barrows
were also burial-places, but those who raised them
burned their dead. The great pyramids of Egypt are
barrows, only they are made of stone, not of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
At Silbury, in Wilts, there is a huge mound, covering
about five acres of ground and some one hundred
and thirty feet in height.</p>

<p>Many interesting things have been brought to light
when these many varieties of barrows have been properly
and scientifically explored by men who have the knowledge
and intelligence to "see" what there is to see, and
who do not attack these old earthworks with the idea of
coming upon some long-hidden hoard of gold or silver.
Indeed, much damage has been done by folk who, from
time to time, have rifled these mysterious old earthworks
with that one, sordid idea. There is much yet
to be done in the way of scientific exploration, and much
to be learned.</p>

<p>The circles of stones at Stonehenge and Avebury seem
to have been connected with the worship of these early
people.</p>

<p>A writer, who has given much attention and study to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the subject, gives us some idea as to how these huge
stones were got into position at Stonehenge. He thinks
that they must have been dragged thither by enormous
numbers of men from the Marlborough Downs.
"Trunks of trees ... pierced with holes for levers
would furnish rollers to propel the stones to very near
their destination. Then it is necessary to suppose the
site of Stonehenge occupied by a mound, artificial or
natural, the ascent being by an easy incline from the
quarter whence these stones were brought. On the top
of the mound we must suppose as many holes dug as
there were upright stones to be placed. On the arrival
of each stone it would be dropped into its hole; and,
when all were thus placed, there would only remain the
more easy task of laying on the imposts, each end of
which has evidently been mortised on to the perpendiculars.
The earth would then be dug away, leaving
the structure complete."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>In 1918 Stonehenge was given to the nation, and we
may hope that what is left of it will be carefully preserved
in the time to come.</p>

<p>Avebury appears to have been made up of a vast circle
of unhewn stones enclosing two other separate double
circles. They are in ruins now, and more than six
hundred and fifty of these huge stones have been destroyed.
There are now standing upright only fifteen;
sixteen have been overthrown, and eighteen are known
to be buried. It seems that folk, who did not understand
or care about these very ancient stones, broke
them up and carried the pieces away to make boundary
walls or to mend roads, and for any other purpose as
they thought fit.</p>

<p>The remains at Avebury are believed to be much older
than those at Stonehenge, dating back a thousand years
or so before Christ. Those at Stonehenge, which covers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
a very much smaller area, seem to belong to the Iron
Age, some two hundred years before Christ.</p>

<p>There are many single stones, especially in Cornwall
and Wales, which also seem to have been connected
with religious rites, but of this we know nothing for
certain. Some are Dolmens&mdash;flat stones, each on four
uprights. In later times they have served as boundary
marks.</p>

<p>In various parts of England there are deep lanes or
cuttings, which have received curious local names.
There are no less than twenty-two such cuttings in
different parts of England all known as Grim's Ditch.
These, no doubt, formed boundaries, separating various
tribes.</p>

<p>The White Horse, cut out of the slope of Uffington
Hill, and several similar objects in Wiltshire, as well as
the crosses&mdash;also cut in the turf&mdash;at Whiteleaf and Bledlow,
may also belong to this period. Some learned men,
however, have thought that they are of a later date.</p>

<p>From these early men, then, the Ancient Britons
appear to have descended, and they were settled here
a good many centuries before the coming of the Romans.
Many of the wild tales and legends still told in country
villages, about giants and fairies, have come down to us
from these early times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
In Roman Times</h2>

<p>Here, then, at the time the Romans first came to
Britain, were tribes of Britons who had been established
in the country for centuries, living their lives according
to the customs of their forefathers, and more or less
cultivating the land. The Romans invaded the country,
and, in time, subdued the people. They remained
masters here for nearly four hundred years, but they
did not make such a permanent impression on this
country as they did on France and Spain.</p>

<p>We are to-day masters of India, but we have not
made India English, nor are we trying to do so. The
natives there go on cultivating the land according to
their custom from time out of mind. They preserve their
own manners, customs, and religions. In places where
they come much in contact with our fellow-countrymen
they are influenced to a certain degree; but in India
to-day the English and the natives lead their own lives,
each race quite apart from the others.</p>

<p>So it was with the Romans in Britain. They formed
colonies in various places and built towns all over the
land; they had country villas dotted here and there,
some little distance from the chief towns, and built
strong military stations in suitable districts. These
posts were kept in communication by means of good
roads.</p>

<p>To trace out the network of Roman roads is a study
in itself, and much has been learned therefrom. Some
roads are still quite easy to trace, as far as their course
is concerned, for many of our great main roads to-day
run upon the top of them; and from time to time, when
excavations are being made for sewers, or for laying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
water-pipes, or tubes for trunk lines of telephones, the
actual metal and foundations of the Roman tracks are
found, many feet below the present level of the road.
It is sometimes stated that the Roman roads were
always straight, and that all obstacles were cleared
to make room for them. Whilst it is quite true that
this "straightness" and directness was one of the characteristics
of these roads, the makers of them were skilled
engineers, and they not infrequently found that some
older trackway, not particularly straight, was better
suited for their purpose, as it avoided some of the
natural difficulties of the country. When they used
these older ways they took care to raise the surface and
lay the metal on firm foundations, so that the traffic
along them could be as rapid as along the new, straight
roads&mdash;and the Romans were great people for getting
about rapidly from point to point. One of the most
frequent deposits of "rubbish" which the Romans have
left behind is "oyster shells", often met with in quantities.
They are found in places many miles away from
the river-mouths where the oysters were cultivated; so
that the question arises: "How did these shells get
there?" Either they must have been brought very
rapidly from the coast far inland, or the eaters of them
did not mind eating them when they were very "high".
At any rate, there the shells have been found, showing
that distance was no obstacle in the way of getting, not
only the things which they reckoned to be necessaries,
but expensive luxuries as well. Although the main
Roman roads are still in use, there are a great number
of cross-roads, which for centuries have been out of use,
and their exact courses can only be traced with difficulty,
passing as they do through what are now quiet, secluded
places, long overgrown by grass and underwood and
cultivated fields.</p>

<p>Many Britons must in the course of time have adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Roman ways and Roman civilization; but the bulk of
the Britons, living away from the Roman centres, kept
to their own customs, and cultivated the ground in the
way their ancestors had done. They prospered, on the
whole, as the Romans kept the various tribes from
quarrelling with one another.</p>

<p>No doubt, in districts such as that which we now call
Hampshire, and along the Thames valley, where wealthy
Romans had their country villas, Roman methods of
farming were in use. The Britons would see something
of Roman ways of doing things, and perhaps tried to
copy them.</p>

<p>But the Romans have not left many marks upon our
towns and villages. It is quite true that a large number
of our present towns and cities are on the <em>sites</em> of, or
near, Roman towns; but, in most cases, we have to dig
down into the earth to find Roman remains. The most
important Roman city, Verulam, has quite disappeared,
and the most complete remains of a Roman town, Silchester,
are near to what is now a quiet country village.
The present cities of London, Winchester, Gloucester,
Lincoln, Chester, Carlisle, and the towns of Colchester
and Leicester, and several others, can hardly be said to
have sprung from Roman towns, though they stand on
their sites.</p>

<p>Most of the Roman cities were built in districts where
the Britons had been strong, or where they were likely
to give trouble. Carlisle and Gloucester were, for instance,
military towns because they were on the borders
of the Roman territory. London and Winchester were
trading cities, and they developed much in Roman
times.</p>

<p>But, when the Roman power was withdrawn, there
was, in those cities at any rate, a British population
which had adopted very extensively Roman customs and
ideas. For a time things went on much as they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
done while the Romans were here; in fact, until the
struggles with the Saxons began.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the coming of the Saxons began
a good while before the Romans actually left. Various
tribes of Saxons attacked different parts of the coast, and
with varying success. Colchester had to keep a sharp
look-out for them on the east coast; and the Romans
built Portchester Castle, in Hampshire, to guard the
south coast.</p>

<p>Christianity had found its way to Britain during
Roman times, and that helped in the work of civilizing
the Britons. But we do not know very much of the
early British Church. Christianity probably made more
headway among the population in and near the Roman
towns than in the wilder districts. The foundations of
an early Christian church have been found at Silchester.</p>

<p>Silchester was a very important Roman town, although
now, as we have noted, but a small village stands on the
spot. Much careful excavation work has been carried
on there, and more is known of this Roman city than
of any other in England. Other sites of Roman cities
are waiting a similar careful exploration, amongst them
Verulam, by the city of St. Alban.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
Early Saxon Times</h2>

<p>The conquest of South Britain by the Saxons took a
long time&mdash;considerably over one hundred and fifty
years. A great many people are born, and live their
lives, and die, in such a period of time as that. It was
only little by little that the various tribes of Saxons got
a footing in England. They were the stronger and
fiercer race, and the Britons were gradually subdued
or driven into the mountainous regions by them.</p>

<p>Those early tribes of Saxons, who came to Britain,
brought with them, of course, their own special manners
and customs. As they settled down, the face of the
country was gradually changed by them. They disliked
and suspected everything Roman, and destroyed
the towns and villas. They hated the idea of walled
towns. These, therefore, were left in ruins, and the
great highways, being neglected in most places, were,
in the course of years, overgrown with brushwood and
hidden in thick forests.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country the Saxons seem to have
completely swept the Britons away, and almost all traces
of them vanished; but in other parts there certainly
were some of them left, because we have still their
marks upon our language. Although most of the place-names
in use now are Saxon or Danish, there are still a
good many of British, or partly British, origin.</p>

<p>The names of many of our rivers are British or Celtic,
such as Axe, Exe, Stour, Ouse, and Yare. So are
many names of hills; and in some parts of the country
the names of the villages are partly British and partly
Saxon. Take, for instance, such a common name as
Ashwell. Some learned men think that it is made up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of two words "Ash" and "Well", both meaning pretty
much the same thing, <em>ash</em> being British for "water",
and <em>well</em> being Saxon for "watering-place". Now, if
the Saxons had quite got rid of the Britons, they would
not have known that a particular place was called
"Ash"&mdash;they learned to call it "Ash" from the natives,
but they did not know what it meant. They knew that
there was a spring of water there, which they called a
"well"; and so, to distinguish it from other wells in
the neighbourhood, they got into the habit of calling
it "Ashwell"&mdash;and the name has stuck to the place.
In North America, in Australia, New Zealand, and
South Africa there are many instances of English
names being grafted on to original native names, and
often you find places with well-known English names
and others with picturesque and descriptive native names
almost side by side.</p>

<p>In some such way as this many other place-names,
partly British and partly Saxon, were formed; and they
teach us this&mdash;that Saxons and Britons must have lived
near each other closely enough for the Saxons to take
up and use some British names.</p>

<p>There are some English counties in which you will
hardly find one place-name which is not Saxon. This
shows us that the Britons were either killed or completely
driven away. That is the case in Hertfordshire.
But in Hampshire, while most of the names are Saxon,
there are many partly Saxon and partly British. The
same thing can be noticed in the county of Gloucester.
The Britons, then, must have been in these districts
long enough for the Saxons to pick up a good many
place-names. They did not understand the meaning of
them, and so tacked on to them names which they <em>did</em>
understand, much as British settlers have done in various
parts of the world during these last few centuries.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>REMAINS OF A ROMAN HOUSE, EXCAVATED AT SILCHESTER</p>
<p>[See page <a href="#Page_17">17</a>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>The place-names of the old towns and villages all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
had a meaning, and when we can get to know what
that meaning is it tells us something of the history of
the place. But we have to be very careful in studying
place-names not to jump to conclusions as to what the
name means. To get at the truth a knowledge of the
old language and the alterations it has undergone, and
also of the different ways in which the word was spelt,
according to the earliest documents that can be found,
is necessary. In days gone by, before the study of
the old forms of the language was properly grasped,
antiquaries often made guesses at the meaning of place-names
which have turned out to be very misleading.
So we must not be in a hurry to jump to conclusions,
and should be always on the look-out for more and
better information. We frequently meet with the syllable
<em>ing</em> in a place-name. "Ing", amongst those
early Saxon settlers here, usually meant "the sons of".
When they made a new home in this strange land the
little band naturally gave the place the name of their
family. Thus, the sons of a man named Offa were
known as Uffingas, and called the name of the place
where they settled Uffinggaston, or Uffington&mdash;and the
name stuck to the place long after the family itself had
died out. The sons of Rede settled at Reading; the
sons of Billinge, the Billings, at Billingham; the sons
of Hôc at Woking and Wokingham; the Ardings at
Ardington; the Thurings at Thorington&mdash;and so on.
You must not, however, conclude that every name you
come across with "ing" in it has the same meaning;
but it will be quite worth while to ask for information
about it from someone who knows, or who can put you
in the way of getting information upon the point.</p>

<p>We cannot go further here into other syllables found
in a large number of place-names, such as <em>feld</em>, <em>yard</em>,
<em>stock</em> or <em>stoke</em>, or <em>ham</em>, but it is quite possible for you to
find out first of all what is the meaning of the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the town or village in which you live, and what that
tells you about its history.</p>

<p>The Saxons made their settlements at first away from
the Roman towns and British villages. In the course
of time, in a good many cases, they made settlements
very close to these old sites, and we know that Saxons
lived in such places as Winchester, Gloucester, and London.
We find, especially in Hampshire and Gloucestershire,
that near, or in, certain villages with Saxon names,
Roman remains have from time to time been dug up.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
Early Saxon Villages</h2>

<p>It is with the coming of the Saxons that the history of
our towns and villages really begins. For, though there
are not a few places which show some connection with
Romans, Britons, and Pit-dwellers, it is mainly from
Saxon times that we can follow the history of the places
in which we live, with any certainty.</p>

<p>When the Saxons came to Britain they brought their
own ideas with them, of course. Nowadays, when English
folk go to settle in a distant land, they take their
English notions with them. They find, however, in the
course of time, that they have to modify or alter them
somewhat, according to the circumstances in which they
are placed. They may find that roast beef and plum-pudding
do not at all suit them in the new climate. If
they are wise, they will see whether the food-stuffs used
by the natives, and folk who have lived out there for
many years, are not more suitable, even though they
may be inclined to despise such food at first.</p>

<p>Now the Saxon tribes which first settled in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
in the fifth century belonged to a race of people bold,
strong, fierce, and free. But they could not make
their new homes exactly what their old ones had been
in the land whence they had come.</p>

<p>Like those other Aryan people, who had made their
way to Britain in the Stone Age, they lived together in
families. When the family became too large, some of
the members had to turn out, like bees from a hive,
though not in such great numbers, and set out on their
travels to form new settlements, or village communities.</p>

<p>This idea of a village community had come down to
them through many generations. The early Saxon idea
of a village community was something of this sort:&mdash;</p>

<div><a name="saxon_brooch_found_at_abingdon_made_of_gold_encrusted_with_coloured_glass" id="saxon_brooch_found_at_abingdon_made_of_gold_encrusted_with_coloured_glass"></a></div>
<div class="image-right">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Saxon Brooch found at Abingdon,
made<br /> of gold encrusted with coloured
glass</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>All the men of the family had equal rights; though
there was one who was head of the family, and who took
the lead. The affairs of the family were discussed and
settled at open-air meetings, called folk-moots. The spot
where these were held was regarded as a sacred place.
The tilling of their land, their marriages, their quarrels,
their joining with other villages to make war or peace,
were all settled at the folk-moot. The question whether
the younger branches of the family should leave the
village and go out and form another was fixed by the
folk-moot also. In the course of time many such little
swarms left the parent hive, and settled farther away.
But they always looked back
upon the old settlement as their
home, and the head of the family
as their chief. They were all of
one <em>kin</em>, and in the course of time
they began to look upon their
chief as their king.</p>

<p>Now what was the nature of the
old Saxon village settlement? In
its general arrangement it was very
like the old Pit-dwellers' settlement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
There was the open space where the men of the
village met, the sacred mound where the folk-moot was
held. The houses in which the family dwelt were placed
close together, round the hut of the head of the family.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Outside these was a paling of some sort, so that all the
houses were within the enclosure, or "tun", as it was
called; and here calves and other young stock were
reared near the houses. Beyond the enclosure, or tun,
was the open pasture-ground and the arable land, or
land under cultivation. Beyond these would be the
untouched forest-land, or open moorland.</p>

<p>Each man of the tun had a share in these lands; not
to do with as he liked, but to use according to the custom
of his family. The arable land was divided into strips,
and shared amongst the men. However many strips of
land a man might have, he could not have them for all
time. The strips were apparently chosen by lot, and
changed from time to time, so that all had an equal
chance in having the best land. In the same way the
number of cattle a man might turn out to graze on the
pasture-land was regulated. The folk-moot, or meeting
of the people, was a very important assembly, and
through it the little community was governed.</p>

<p>Such was the mode of life to which the Saxons who
came to England had been used; but they were not
nearly as free when they landed here as their ancestors
had been. More and more power had come into the
hands of the chief or king, and to him the people
looked for protection and guidance. In times of war,
or when the tribe was invading new lands, the power of
the king increased. By the time, then, that the Saxon
tribes began their settlement in England, they were very
much under the rule of their chiefs or kings. The kings
had rights and powers over their followers which had
gradually grown up by long custom, and none of those
followers ventured to dispute such rights and powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
Anglo-Saxon Tuns and Vills</h2>

<p>A good many Britons no doubt settled down with the
Saxons as slaves, and that probably accounts for so many
of the natural features of the country&mdash;the rivers and the
hills&mdash;keeping their old British names. The British villages
must have had names, but those villages were
apparently destroyed, and the slaves would be settled
near the homesteads which the conquerors set up.</p>

<p>In fixing on a place for a "tun" the Saxons would
choose a valley rather than a hill, usually near a running
stream, or a plentiful supply of water. At the present
time nearly all over England we can find villages which
have not been touched by modern improvements and
alterations, and most of these show something even now
of their Saxon origin.</p>

<p>For instance, in the county of Rutland there is a village
named Exton, which has for many centuries kept several
features which show its connection with Saxon days.
Its name, Ex-ton, seems to be compounded of the British
word "ex", which means "water", and the Saxon "ton"
or "tun", which means the "enclosure"&mdash;"the tun by
the water". There, sure enough, flowing by the village,
is a stream, a tributary of the River Gwash; just such a
stream as the Saxons loved. In the middle of the village
is the triangular open space, or village green. Round
it the houses are thickly clustered together, with hardly
any garden ground at the back or in front, and most of
them with none at all. Outside the ring of houses are
small grass fields or closes, where calves and cows feed,
and poultry run. These little fields form a kind of ring
round the village, and the hedges enclosing them represent
the old fence of Saxon days, which formed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
"tun". Beyond this are wider pasture-grounds and big
plough-lands, stretching away in several directions up
the gentle slopes.</p>

<p>You will be able to find a good many villages which
have some resemblance to Exton; they answer very
closely to the Anglo-Saxon vill and the Anglo-Saxon
town, for town and village were laid out on the same
principle.</p>

<p>Now look at some little sleepy country town, and you
will see much the same arrangement as in the village.
The wide open space in the middle, where the town
pump stands, and where the market is held, answers to
the village green. Though this is often spoken of as
the Market Square, it is usually more like a triangle in
shape than a square.</p>

<p>The old houses round the market square are built
very closely one into the other, and with queer narrow
alleys leading to houses behind those in front; much in
the same way as the houses are clustered round the
village green. Round the outskirts of the town, at the
back of the houses, are small green closes or paddocks.
Beyond them are the larger meadows and pastures;
then the wide corn-lands and woods; and, not far away,
the heath or common.</p>

<p>The Saxon settlements, the "tuns" or "vills",
whether they afterwards became what we now understand
as "towns" or "cities", or remained what we
call villages, had all the same chief features. Just as
ordinary schoolrooms and railway stations are all pretty
much alike, because they all have to serve much the
same purpose, so the Saxon settlements were very
similar in their general plan.</p>

<p>There was the open place, where people met and the
folk-moot was held, surrounded by the houses of stone
or wood in which the people lived. Around these lay
the grass yards or common homestead; and, beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
them, the wide arable and pasture-lands, with patches of
moorland and forest.</p>

<p>But outside the actual "tun" there would be something
connected with the Saxon settlement which you
would be sure to notice. After you had passed the
boundary to the tun, you would see no hedgerows or
walls dividing the land into fields. The arable land
was one huge field. Its position would depend, of
course, upon the nature of the soil and the lie of the land.
You would not expect to find it down in the water-meadows,
through which the river flowed; it would be
higher up, out of the reach of floods; perhaps on the
hill-sides.</p>

<p>Then you would see the huge field, ploughed in long
strips, about a furlong in length, that is, a "furrow
long",<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and one or two perches in breadth. Between
the ploughed strips would be narrow unploughed strips,
on which, in places, brambles would grow. The heath-lands
and moorlands were uncultivated tracts, where
rough timber and underwood grew, which was cut and
lopped by the people of the vill under certain conditions.
There were no formal spinneys,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> nor wide stretches of
old timber, such as we nowadays expect to see in a
forest. In places the forests contained old timber, and
were thick with undergrowth, and infested with wild
animals, such as wolves and boars. The name forest
was often given to an uncultivated district, not much
differing from a rough common, where sheep, cattle, and
swine could pick up a living.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
Tythings and Hundreds&mdash;Shires</h2>

<p>Though the Saxons, as they settled down in England,
formed "tuns", which at first had very little to do with
one another, that state of things probably did not last a
very long time. In fighting the Britons they had to act
together; and, for the sake of protection and help, these
separate communities had to combine. Somewhat in
this way ten families in a district would form a tything;
and the heads of the villages would, from time to time,
meet together to consult on various matters in which
they were interested.</p>

<p>Then larger areas would need to be covered, as the
country became more settled. Ten tythings would
make a hundred; and, from time to time, men from all
the places in the hundred would meet together and hold
hundred courts. The meeting-place for the hundred was
always some well-known spot, selected originally because
of its convenient situation&mdash;some particular tree was a
favourite place; and, as the folk met there regularly so
many times in the year, the spot was easily kept in
mind from one generation to another. At the meeting
criminals were tried, disputes settled, and in the later
times, when monasteries had become common, some
sort of record was often made of the important matters
decided upon, and kept with the documents belonging to
the monastery, as being a safe place in which to keep
them. Scraps of these ancient records have been met
with on old parchments which in later times have been
used over again for another purpose.</p>

<p>Most of the English counties are still divided into
hundreds. In those days the hundreds were not all of
the same size, because, owing to the nature of the soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
some tuns were far apart from one another, and a
tything might cover a wide district, and a hundred a
much larger area. If the hundred was small, that would
show that the tuns were pretty close together, and that
the district was populous. If, on the other hand, the
tythings and hundreds were large, that would show that
the district was thinly peopled.</p>

<p>We have seen that new settlements were formed by
portions of the family leaving the old home, and making
a new tun in the most suitable place they could find.
It would happen, no doubt, in favourable districts, that
new tuns would spring up not very far from the mother
tun; and, in the course of time, there would be a good
many more tuns in the tything than there were originally.
The fact seems to be, that when once the boundaries
had been roughly agreed upon, they were not often
altered. From being a combination of families, or tuns,
the tything got to be a district; and it kept its name
of tything long after the number of tuns in it had
increased.</p>

<p>It was much the same with the hundreds. In time
they were represented by certain districts, whose borders
were known to the people living in them. The hundreds
all over the country have not altered their boundaries to
any great extent until quite recently. In Hampshire
to-day there are thirty-seven hundreds; in Hertfordshire
there are only eight; and Middlesex has now the same
six hundreds which it had twelve centuries ago when a
good part of the county was forest land.</p>

<p>As to the time when the hundreds became grouped
into shires we cannot speak definitely; the change was
brought about gradually and quite naturally. It is not
at all likely that all the various kingdoms in England
came together on some particular occasion and said:
"Now we'll divide all our kingdoms into shires". But
the hundreds did become grouped into shires, doubtless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
because it was necessary that they might act together in
matters which concerned all.</p>

<div><a name="ploughing_from_an_old_saxon_calendar_in_the_british_museum" id="ploughing_from_an_old_saxon_calendar_in_the_british_museum"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Ploughing. From an old Saxon Calendar in the British Museum</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>There is nothing like a threatened danger from without
to draw men together. We have seen this in a most
remarkable way during the Great War. In the tun, no
doubt, the villagers fell out with each other; however
fairly the strips of land were shared somebody was sure
to get what he did not like, and to grumble about it.
Some of his fellow-villagers would take his side, and
say it was a shame; and others would take the opposite
side. But if the cattle belonging to the tun over the
hills, or on the other side of the marsh, had been seen
on the wrong side of the mark, or boundary which
separated the lands of the two tuns, the dispute about
the strips in the field would be forgotten, and away the
people would go in a body towards the offending tun
"to see about it".</p>

<p>In much the same way, when the boundaries of a
tything or hundred were invaded by another tything
or hundred, the differences between the tuns would be
dropped, in order to preserve the rights which they had
in common.</p>

<p>There was strife among the Saxon kingdoms which
lasted for many years, especially between the three great
rivals, Wessex, Mercia, and Northumbria. The lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
kingdoms were under the dominion, sometimes of one,
sometimes of another of these rivals. All this fighting
and settling down put more and more power into the
hands of the kings. Instead of each village fighting for
itself, and leaving all the others to fight for themselves,
it was found to be a much safer and wiser policy to join
together for common protection. Now if people join together,
whether in peace or war, to win a football match
or to take a city, somebody must be in authority to give
the necessary orders. Hence the power of the king, and
the officers acting under him, grew up <em>by custom</em>, until
the overlordship of the king was so firmly established
that no one dared call it in question.</p>

<p>Apparently from the smaller Saxon kingdoms we get
our older shires. Whether the overlord happened to be
the King of Mercia, or the King of Wessex, the under-king
continued to rule over his old kingdom, or share.
When, at length, in the ninth century, the King of
Wessex was acknowledged as the overlord or King of
England, Wessex and Mercia, and a part of Northumbria,
were gradually divided into <em>shares</em>, or shires, over each
of which the King of England appointed a reeve to look
after his interests&mdash;the shire-reeve or sheriff. The King
of England still appoints the high sheriff of each county.
An eorlderman, who, in the case of the older shires, was
at first no doubt a descendant of the old under-king,
looked after the business of the shire itself.</p>

<p>Amongst the older shires we have Kent, Surrey,
Sussex, Essex, Middlesex; while the newer ones were
all named after some important central town, which in
each case gave its name to the shire; such are Hertfordshire
and Bedfordshire. You can easily pick these out
from a list of the counties of England at the present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
The Early English Town</h2>

<p>At first, as we have seen, the Saxons were an agricultural
people, and each village or tun produced all that
it needed for its own support. But in peaceful times
a tun might produce more than it needed; and by and
by something like trade and exchange between one
place and another would begin. There were many
places, as for example London, which in Roman times
had been great places for commerce, to which ships
had come bringing various kinds of goods. In time,
as the Saxons settled down, they began to have new
wants, and some of them began to be attracted towards
places where there were more people than in their native
tuns. Some men found that they could make certain
articles of common use better than their neighbours
could. Thus certain trades took their rise. Those who
worked at them would gradually give up the agricultural
labour in which everybody else in the tun was employed.
We do not know the causes which led certain of these
agricultural tuns to become trading-places, but it is quite
certain that they did gradually grow to be what we now
call towns.</p>

<p>We find Saxon towns springing up near the places
where some of the Roman towns had been, in some
cases on the actual site of the Roman city. In Gloucester
and Lincoln, for instance, some of the streets to-day
follow the actual lines of the Roman streets. These
towns are, however, really Saxon towns, not old Roman
towns turned into Saxon towns. The men of these
Saxon towns had lands on the outskirts of the towns, just
as the village men had. Even to-day you will notice
that there are many towns which possess lands called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
by such names as the Townlands, Townfield, or Lammas
Land.</p>

<p>The men in these towns were, from the very first, more
inclined to hold out against an overlord than the men in
the villages were. In the first place, their numbers were
greater; and then they had more varieties of occupation
than the villagers, or, as we may say, had wider interests.
In the trading towns, like London and Southampton,
they came in contact with traders from other lands, and
trade brought them more wealth. They, too, had their
folk-moots, and they had more business to transact in
them than the country villagers had. They were very
particular to keep a tight hold on their rights, and were
always on the look-out to gain fresh privileges if they
possibly could.</p>

<p>The fence or wall, which surrounded the town, was
made much stronger than that round the village; and
men saw the use now of the thick walls of the old Roman
cities which their ancestors had despised, for they had
wealth and goods which needed protection.</p>

<p>We have seen that the power of the king gradually
increased; and, as it did so, the king and the town became
more necessary to each other. The town was
wealthy; but it could not stand by itself against all the
rest of the country. The king had the power of the
country at his back, and could protect it if he would.
The town had to give something to the king in return
for this protection. But we shall presently see more of
the relations between king and town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
In Early Christian Times</h2>

<p>One great and important factor in the making of Saxon
England was Christianity. The first Saxons who came
were heathen, and they wiped out the British Christianity,
where they settled, as completely as they wiped out Roman
civilization. Towards the end of the sixth century
Christian missionaries were at work in the north and in
the south of what we now call England, and from that
time onwards the Church played an important part in
the making of the nation.</p>

<p>So, side by side with the development and political
growth of the country came the spread of Christianity
and the organization of the Church. We find that the
folk in the Saxon kingdoms, following the lead of their
kings, became Christian as a matter of course. Over
and over again we find the kings giving up Christianity
and going back to paganism, and their people following
them, also as a matter of course. The conversion of
England took many years to accomplish, and mixed up
with the Christianity was much paganism, which was not
overcome for many centuries. The dioceses<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the
early Saxon bishops were, roughly speaking, of the same
extent as the early kingdoms, and the bishops and their
clergy travelled about as missionaries.</p>

<p>As the lords or thanes of the various vills, following
the example of their kings, accepted Christianity, their
people followed their example. In the open places of the
tuns and vills, where the folk-moots were held, Christianity
was preached and the cross set up. That, probably, was
the origin of most of the village and market crosses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Then, in the course of time, in some cases, a church was
built on a part of the old sacred open spaces. You cannot
help noticing to-day how in many towns the chief
church is by the market-place, and in the villages by the
village green. In other cases we find the church and
manor-house are outside the present village. That may
be because the thane's or lord's land was outside the vill
or tun, and he built the church on his own land, not on
the common public land in the middle of the tun. It may
have happened, also, that at the time the church was first
built the houses were there also; but, owing to changes
many years afterwards, the people have removed to another
spot some distance away&mdash;possibly to the side of a
busy main road. Then the original village has dwindled
away; the houses, having fallen into ruin, have been
pulled down, and no trace of them is now left.</p>

<p>A priest would be appointed by the bishop, to work in
a tun, and a portion of land would be set apart in the
common fields to maintain him and to aid in carrying
on the services of the church. In course of time there
were certain dues and fees given to him, the paying of
which became a recognized custom. Somewhat in this
way glebe lands and tithes took their rise, and became a
part of the land system of the Saxon people.</p>

<p>Along with the growth of churches in the tuns and
vills was the founding of monasteries. Small bodies of
men bound themselves by simple rules to live and work
and worship together. Frequently they made their
settlements in lonely, desolate places, which they worked
to bring under cultivation. So there sprang up settlements,
or convents, of these religious people, living
under their own rules. Work and worship went side
by side. It was a new kind of life, different from the
life in the "tun" which the early Saxons were used to;
but in time it had a mighty influence in the land, and
played an important part in the making of England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
Monasteries</h2>

<p>The Saxons learned to respect the quiet simple lives
of the early monks. They saw them toiling hard in
their fields, bravely facing many difficulties and hardships,
and turning the wilderness into a garden. At
first each monk, from the abbot downwards, had to
take his share in the toil, wherever it was, and the
monastery, as well as the vill, had to produce all that
it needed.</p>

<p>Men who were not very good or very religious began
to respect the lives and works of the monks. We find
thanes and kings not only allowing monks to settle on
some of their unoccupied land, but making over to them
some of their own land, on condition that they and their
children after them might always have a share in the
prayers of these good men. We see, too, that whole vills
came gradually into the hands of some monasteries;
so that the convent became the lord of the vill instead of
a thane or a king.</p>

<p>Some convents made rapid progress, while others
never prospered, but in the course of time disappeared.
We have seen that the vill and the "town" grew up in
much the same way, and were formed on the same plan.
There are, however, a good many towns which grew up
round monasteries in the first instance.</p>

<p>For example, King Offa II, at the end of the eighth
century, founded the monastery of St. Alban, giving to
it a wide extent of land round the ruins of the old city of
Verulam. The monastery was built, and much land
brought under cultivation. We find the sixth abbot,
Ulsinus, two centuries later, encouraging people to settle
round the walls of the monastery. That monastery lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
near one of the great roads of England; many people
were coming and going; so houses were built and a
market was established. Churches, too, were erected
for the use of the people who settled in the town. The
abbot was the lord of this "town", and the people dwelling
in it were his tenants. He, like any other lord of a
"tun", or "vill", was responsible for the keeping of
order and good government on his land.</p>

<p>St. Edmund's Bury, or Bury St. Edmund's, grew up
round a monastery which had been established in a
lonely place; and there, also, arose in time a flourishing
town, under the rule of the abbot.</p>

<p>A number of towns, which to-day are cathedral cities,
grew up round the churches where the bishop and his
principal clergy had their homes and chief centres of
work.</p>

<p>These things only came about very gradually. The
monks who settled first at Bury, or those whom King
Offa settled by the ruins of Verulam, never dreamed
that in the years to come their convents would be great
landowners, with many hundreds of tenants. But it
was so; and the monasteries at length formed one of the
most important classes of landowners in the country;
their special rights and privileges coming to them so
gradually, and so naturally, that no one realized exactly
what was taking place.</p>

<p>Those who entered a monastery, or embraced "the
religious life", intended to keep out of the world, and
apart from its cares and worries as much as they could.
But the lands left to them had to be looked after and
cultivated. These did not always lie close round the
monastery&mdash;very frequently they were tracts of land in
distant counties&mdash;and somebody had to look after them.
New possessions bring new responsibilities; and so we
we find that the monasteries had not only to attend to the
daily round of worship and work inside the walls of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
monastery, but had to carry on all the business belonging
to great estates as well.</p>

<p>So in time a monastery had to use the services of
many men besides monks; the monks became great
employers of labour one way and another, and this
attracted to their towns a good many skilled workmen.</p>

<p>The times when the Danes ravaged the greater part
of the country were very trying to the life of English
villages and towns. These sea-rovers came, at first,
as plunderers, and the destruction of towns, churches,
and monasteries was very great. Some monasteries,
like Crowland<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, suffered several times, and many were
never rebuilt. But gradually the invaders themselves
settled in England. They did not bring with them an
entirely new land system. As they settled down to
farming and village life, we find that land was held
in almost exactly the same manner as under Saxon
customs.</p>

<p>Of course there were some differences, and those who
have studied the subject closely can indicate a good
many points in which the Saxon and Danish land
customs differed from each other. The dangers to
which the Saxons had been exposed by the attacks of
the Danes had put a great deal of power into the hands
of the thanes and the king. Thus, by the time the
Danes had settled in England, every vill and tun had
got into the hands of some lord or thane, or was in
the king's hands. In Danish settlements there seems
always to have been an overlord, who led his people
in war and ruled in time of peace; though there was
a class of freemen amongst them which had special
rights and privileges. You will remember that when
King Alfred came to terms with the Danes at the Peace
of Wedmore, in the year 880, it was agreed that the
part of England east of the old Roman road, Watling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Street, which ran from London to Chester, should be
regarded as Danish territory. In that district you will
find a good many Danish place-names as well as the
older Saxon place-names&mdash;names which end in "by",
"ey", "ness", "wic", and "thorpe". A great many
will be found in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, and
farther north. But some will also be found in other
parts of the country. For instance; there is in Hampshire,
in the valley of the River Meon, quite a little
nest of Danish place-names&mdash;a fact which shows that
Danes settled in that district even in the midst of what
may be called a Saxon stronghold.</p>

<p>But the Danes were something more than tillers of
the soil; they were traders too, and "tuns" became
in many places more like our "towns" and trading-places
than ever they had been before. In time we find
the largest towns in the Danish part of England&mdash;Leicester,
Lincoln, Derby, Nottingham, and Stamford&mdash;binding
themselves together to protect their trading

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
Towns and Villages in the Time of<br />
Cnut the Dane</h2>

<p>Now let us see what an ordinary village was like
in the time of King Cnut, when Saxon and Dane were
living pretty comfortably together, side by side, under
good government.</p>

<p>We find that each vill or tun had a lord, an eorl,
or thane, who practically owned the place and everything
in it, though he could not do entirely as he liked.
There was the land which belonged to him, and which
was in his own hands, or occupation, as we say; that
was called his demesne. The rest of the land was
also his, but it was let out to people who had lived
on the land from time out of mind&mdash;the cheorls or
villeins. The lord's house was on his demesne. The
villeins' houses were all together in the tun, with the
grass yards for the cattle close to them, and the open
fields and pasture-lands outside the tun, just as they
had been in the olden days.</p>

<p>There seems to have been two classes of villeins&mdash;geburs
and cottiers.</p>

<p>The geburs were the higher class. They appear very
frequently to have held about one hundred and twenty
acres of land; they had to work on the lord's home farm
two or three days a week, or pay him certain produce
of the land as a rent; and they had to provide one
or more oxen for the village plough, when there was
ploughing to be done on the lord's farm, or in the
common field.</p>

<p>In the Danish part of the country there appears to
have been a class of freeholders, in some places, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
socmen, but there were not very many of them. They,
no doubt, had had their rights granted to them for distinguished
service in the Danish wars.</p>

<p>The cottiers held only about five acres of land. They
had to work for the thane or lord on certain days of the
week; but, as they had no oxen, they had no ploughing
to do for him.</p>

<p>Below the geburs and the cottiers were the theows,
thralls, or slaves, who could be bought and sold. They
were captives taken in war, or men who, for their crimes,
had been doomed to slavery.</p>

<p>We must remember that the overlord might be the
king or a bishop, a monastery or a thane. Their rights
over their vills and tuns were much the same in each
case, and their duties to those vills and tuns were also
similar.</p>

<p>A very large number of vills and tuns were under the
lordship of the various bishops and monasteries. It was
so with towns like Winchester, Reading, Bury St.
Edmund's, and St. Alban's. The custom had grown
up quite naturally and in the course of many years.</p>

<p>It is pretty clear that the overlord did not always
reside in his vill or tun. The tuns or vills of the
bishopric of Winchester, for instance, were scattered
about in the various parts of the diocese. It was the
same with other overlords. But we find in every place
a steward, and in each town the king's reeve or the
lord's reeve. These acted for the overlord, whoever
he was, and saw that the villeins and cottiers did their
proper proportion of work at the right time; they saw
that the lord's tolls at the markets, fairs, and ferries,
were properly enforced. The steward was a most important
officer in every town and village, and a great
deal of power was in his hands.</p>

<p>Then in the ordinary country vill there was the faber,
or smith; the mason; the pundar, or man who looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
after the fences and hedges and drove stray cattle into
the pound. Then there was the carpenter, and even
the bee-keeper, for honey was an important ingredient
used in the making of the drink of the community.
The simple ordinary trades were found in the country
villages then, as they are now; but the craftsmen, the
most skilled workmen, had become for the most part
dwellers in the towns. Even in very early times we
find craftsmen in towns formed into trades' unions
or guilds, to protect their special trades.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Agriculture. From an eleventh-century manuscript in the British Museum</i></p>
<p><i>Below are shown the workers carrying their burdens home at the
end of the day.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Now the land was shared amongst the villeins and
cottiers in strips, usually containing an acre or halfacre,
in the common fields of which we have heard
before. The villein did not have all the strips belonging
to his holding set out side by side&mdash;they lay in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
different parts of the great open field. Crops had to be
sown according to the custom of the vill or tun, and
according to a fixed order. Wheat and rye would be
sown one year on a part of the great field; barley, oats,
and beans the next year; and the third year the land
must be left fallow. The lord's land had to be treated in
the same way.</p>

<p>On the pasture-land and in the meadows the villein
and cottier had the right to turn out a certain number of
cattle, according to the size of their holdings. The
crops, whether of hay or corn, had to be cleared from
the fields by certain fixed days, so that cattle might be
turned out to graze. You will still find, in some towns,
that certain of the freeholders, or burgesses, have the
right to turn a certain number of cattle on certain lands
for a part of the year between fixed dates.</p>

<p>Then, on the rough commons or heaths there were
also grazing rights for the lord and his tenants. The
tenants might "top and lop" the trees growing there at
certain times, but they might not cut the trees down&mdash;that
was the lord's right. There were also rights of cutting
turf and heather, and the turning of hogs into the
forest; all these rights were ruled by "custom", which
bound both the lord and the tenants.</p>

<p>These "customs", although they were very similar,
were not the same in every place&mdash;each community had
its own special "customs" which were clung to most
rigidly from generation to generation. However much
inclined the lord or his reeve might be to try to get rid
of the old "customs" in order to get more power into
his own hands, or to make more out of the tenants, he
was forced to respect the "custom" of the place or there
would be grievous trouble. And it was a good thing
that both lords and tenants had thus to respect each the
right of the other, for it has helped to foster from the
very early days that spirit which makes for liberty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
which we value so highly, so that a man may live his
life in security and freedom.</p>

<p>The lord, or steward, or reeve, held courts or meetings
at regular intervals. At first these took place in
the open air, like the old folk-moots; but in time they
came to be held in a court-house. The court was a
meeting, presided over by the lord or his steward, to see
that the customs of the place were kept up; to call to
account those tenants who had failed to do their share
of the work; to put new tenants into the places of those
who had removed or died; and to punish offenders.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Ploughing. From an eleventh-century<br /> manuscript

</div></div>

<p>This last right, of punishing offenders, was one
thought to be of vast importance. In the early days
the men of the tun were bound together to keep the
peace, and to see that it was kept; and they were strong
enough to keep evil-doers in check. In the trading tuns
or towns especially the right was valued very highly;
but, at the time we are now treating of, the right to
exercise punishment was in the hands of the overlord,
though the men of the place had still some voice in the
government of their town. The right to have a gallows
was one eagerly sought for, and held very firmly; not
because people particularly wanted to hang one another,
but because the gallows represented to them the highest
power of government. The towns had lost most of their
rights in this respect, but they had never forgotten those
they had had,
and were always
on the alert to
get back any lost
right, or to gain
a new one which
should help them
to obtain the
privilege of self-government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
Churches and Monasteries in Danish<br />
and Later Saxon Times</h2>

<p>In speaking of our towns and villages we are obliged
to make mention frequently of churches and monasteries.
At the time when Cnut was king, each vill or tun had its
church and its priest to minister in it. There were parts
of the land, in the common fields and pasture, mixed up
with the villeins' strips, set apart for the support of the
services of the Church, the maintenance of the priest,
and the care of the poor. In time various dues and
customs were also paid to the priest for certain things
which he was expected to do.</p>

<p>There are very few churches still standing which have
any parts of their structure dating from before the time
of King Cnut. In the early days churches were very
simple buildings, built mainly of wood, and in the
Danish wars most of them were destroyed.</p>

<p>In the tenth century there was a very general belief
that the world was coming to an end at the end of the
thousand years after the establishment of Christianity;
so there was not much actual church-building going on.
But in King Cnut's time a revival of interest in church-building
took place, and there are in a good many of the
old churches of England little bits of work in the walls,
or very rude carvings over the doorways, which belong
to this time. Unless such work is pointed out to you by
one who understands something about these matters, you
will not be likely to discover it for yourself, any more
than you are likely to discover the traces of the pit-dwellings,
of which we spoke in an early chapter.</p>

<p>These parish churches and parish priests were under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the control of the bishop, who had his chief church or
cathedral in some important place in his diocese. Those
cathedrals were generally served by colleges of clergy,
called canons.</p>

<div><a name="wooden_church_at_greenstead_essex" id="wooden_church_at_greenstead_essex"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>These were the public churches. But besides them
there were colleges and monasteries, which were private
societies of men living together. Some of the religious
houses were in towns, as we have seen, and others were
in wild desolate places. Every religious house, whether
a monastery for men or a nunnery for women, had its
church, which was the private chapel of the house, and
not open to the public. In the course of years these
private chapels were built as huge churches, much larger
than the parish church. Even now you may see standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
close to a big college church a much smaller parish
church; as, for example, St. Margaret's Church, which
stands by the side of Westminster Abbey. As more
land came into the possession of these religious houses,
the monks had more business with the outside world;
for, as landlords, they had to see that their lands were
turned to good account, and cultivated according to the
notions of the day.</p>

<p>The monasteries, especially in their early days, were
great centres of good and useful work. Those who
founded them, or gave them lands, did so because they
felt they were doing excellent service for the people, and
they wanted to have a share in the work, and to be remembered
in the prayers of the monks. Founders of
religious houses believed that they were getting something
worth having in return for the lands which they
gave.</p>

<p>In the wild times of the Danish invasions the monasteries
were looked upon as places of safety for the weak
and helpless. But they were not always safe places.
Sometimes, when the country was in a disturbed state,
people would send their valuables to the nearest monastery.
In time the Danes got to know of this, and many
a religious house was attacked and sacked by them on
account of the tales they had heard of the marvellous
wealth hidden there.</p>

<p>A story is told of a worthy person living near St.
Alban's monastery at a time when a visit from marauding
Danes was expected. One market-day he sent a
number of heavy iron-bound chests, guarded by armed
men, through the market to the monastery. Everybody,
of course, turned to look, and talked about the affair.
As a matter of fact the chests only contained stones; the
treasure was carefully hidden somewhere else, till all
danger was thought to be over. That plan was used
to put the Danes "off the scent" as we should say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
All the land that did not go with the tuns and vills in
early days was apparently regarded as belonging to the
people, and was called the folk-land. There was a great
deal of this unoccupied land, and it was not regarded at
the time as being of much use to anybody. The king
came to be regarded as the custodian or guardian of
these folk-lands. Little by little they became the property
of the king, until practically he could do what he
pleased with them. It was from these folk-lands&mdash;which
in early times were probably scraps of land which nobody
thought to be worth very much, since the nearest vills
or tuns had never taken them in&mdash;that kings gave land
to bishoprics and monasteries. By and by these rough
lands became very valuable; but in most cases it was the
labour, the skill, and the brains of the monks in the early
days which turned the waste lands into fruitful fields.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
Later Saxon Times</h2>

<p>Every old town and village has got its oldest house,
of course. You will most likely have heard people
trying to be funny about it, and saying they think it
must have been built in the year One. There is, we
may pretty safely say, no house now standing exactly
as it was in the days of King Cnut and the later Saxon
times. But even yet there are some buildings standing,
and still in use, which have certain parts which were
erected in those times. These buildings are mostly
churches, and in various parts of the country, indeed
in almost every county, something belonging to this
age can be pointed out.</p>

<p>Churches built of stone in those days had very thick
walls with very small windows. The east end of the
chancel was usually semicircular, forming an apse. The
wall between the chancel and the nave was pierced by
a narrow, low, round-headed arch. Most of the windows
had plain, round-headed arches, and in some of them,
dividing the opening into two parts or "lights", were
stone pillars with bulging stems. Some of the doorways
had triangular heads, others had round heads.
There are some very curious bits of sculpture over some
of these doorways. The meaning of them was quite
plain, no doubt, to the people who carved them, but
they are very difficult for us to understand. They represent
the ideas which the Saxons had of good and evil,
and of the strife continually going on between them.</p>

<p>King Edward the Confessor had been brought up in
Normandy, where church-building was in advance of
anything in England. He encouraged Norman ideas
in building, as well as in other directions, and so prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the way for the coming of the Normans. Some
parts of the buildings connected with Westminster
Abbey were built at that time.</p>

<p>We do not know much of Saxon castles, though the
Saxons had their strongholds and fortified places.</p>

<div><a name="saxon_doorway_earls_barton_northampton" id="saxon_doorway_earls_barton_northampton"></a></div>

<img class="mw" src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Saxon Doorway, Earl's Barton,

</div></div>

<p>The houses in which the people lived were most of
them in those days built of wood. There was not much
difference, except in size, between the house of the king,
the thane, and the villein. There was the hearth, on
which was the fire; and the room or hall in which it was
placed was the chief building, close to which, very
gradually, other buildings arose. Apparently the buildings
had a framework of timber, filled in with wood
wattled together like hurdles. In the more important
buildings stone gradually came into use.</p>

<p>The monasteries and convents each had the buildings
in which the monks lived grouped round the church.
After the Danish wars the buildings improved, stone
taking the place of wood.</p>

<p>Even in the towns wood was chiefly used for the
ordinary houses; though, as we should expect, stone
was used in the more important buildings and in the
wall round the town.</p>

<p>What we understand by
comfort in a house was absent.
There was the fire on
the hearth in the middle of the
floor; in this room the people
of the house, from the highest
to the lowest, had their meals;
and there, on the floor, most
of them slept at night. Cooking
was done almost entirely
in the open air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
In Norman Times</h2>

<p>When Duke William of Normandy became King of
England, the power of the Crown was greater than it
had ever been before. All the old folk-land had become
king's land. Many knights had followed Duke William
from Normandy into England, and expected to be provided
for by their leader. The lands belonging to
King Harold, and those of the Saxon eorls who had
died fighting at Senlac, King William regarded as his
own. These he granted to his followers, on condition
that they acknowledged him as their overlord, and
followed him in war when required. This was a
stricter condition than had ever before been required in
England. The Normans were used to it, and it did not
seem at all strange to them.</p>

<p>Neither was it so very strange to the Saxon nobles
and thanes. Most of them were allowed to keep their
estates if they took the oath of allegiance to the king
as the Normans did. Of course they grumbled: it was
only natural that they should do so; but if they did not
acknowledge the king in this way they were looked upon
as rebels, and lost their lands.</p>

<p>King William was very careful, in the grants which
he made, not to put too much power into the hands of
his nobles. The old vills of Saxon times were now
pretty generally called manors. When the king granted
land, it was not given in huge slices&mdash;whole counties,
halves, and quarters of counties&mdash;to this great follower of
his or to that one. Between the old vills, or manors, there
were often wide stretches of the king's own land, the
old folk-land. If he had granted to a Norman knight
a quarter of a county or so, he would have been giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
away much of his own land. Besides that, the king
did not mean his followers to become too powerful.
He granted the land in separate manors. It is quite
true that in every county we can, so to speak, put our
finger on some Norman knight who came over with
William I, and say that he got the lion's share of the
manors in that county. Thus in Hampshire there was
Hugh de Port, and in Hertfordshire Eustace de Boulogne.
But their manors did not all lie side by side, nor
were they conveniently close together. Just as a villein's
holding was spread out in various fields, so the manors,
or fiefs, which a knight held under King William were
often scattered over various counties.</p>

<p>At the time of the Conquest a very large number of
manors belonged to bishoprics and monasteries. Now
the Normans were a Christian race. The Norman Conquest
was not like the Saxon or the Danish Conquest&mdash;a
rush of heathen, bent on plunder and bloodshed.
Bitter as the strife was, it was not as bad as those
invasions had been. There was something which the
Normans and the later Saxons both respected, and that
was their religion. The Normans were a particularly
religious and devout people, stern and cruel as they
were. The lands of the Church and of the monasteries
were not interfered with to any extent. King William,
however, took care that they were in the hands of people
whom he could trust.</p>

<p>The story is told that the Saxon abbot, Frederick of
St. Alban's, who did not love the Normans, once remarked
to King William that he owed his easy conquest
of England to the fact that so many of the manors were
held by monks and clergy, who could not and would
not bring out their men to fight.</p>

<p>The king replied that that must be mended; for
enemies might again invade the land, and he must
have men whom he could depend upon to meet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
foe. At that time a great tract of land between St.
Albans and London belonged to the Abbey, and the
abbot allowed Saxon outlaws to infest it, who were a
great nuisance to the Normans. As the land had been
given by former kings, the king at once took half of it
back again, in order to clear out the outlaws. Abbot
Frederick had said too much. He fled away to the
Camp of Refuge at Ely, and King William would only
accept as abbot a Norman and a friend of his&mdash;Paul
de Caen. That was a very good appointment for St.
Albans. The great tower of the Abbey Church, still
standing, was built by him&mdash;more than eight centuries
ago.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
In Norman Times (<i>Cont.</i>)</h2>

<p>The king, then, granted manors to his followers, and
to such Saxon eorls and thanes as were willing to hold
their lands on the same conditions as the Normans. If
they objected, as from time to time a good many of them
did, they had to go.</p>

<p>Now, though every manor had a lord, where the lord
held many manors it was quite impossible for him to be
living in the manor-house of each of them, and looking
after his estate himself. He could, if he chose, let out
some portions of these manors to a man beneath him in
rank, on exactly the same conditions as the king had
granted to him. The man must swear to be his vassal,
and appear, when required, with his proper number of
men, to fight his lord's battles. He, in his turn, might
let parts of the lands to others under him.</p>

<p>By this means the king could command a pretty large
army. He would summon his great vassals, they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
summon their vassals, each of whom would in turn
summon his followers; and so from every manor men
would be called to fight. It was something like the old
nursery tale: "The fire began to burn the stick; the
stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to worry the
pig; and so the pig began to get over the stile".</p>

<div><a name="domesday_book" id="domesday_book"></a></div>

Office,<br /> London.</i> (<i>1/8 original size.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>If the lord was not living in the manor-house there
was someone there to represent him and to look after
his interests. In scores of manors the people never set
eyes on their overlord; but they felt the grip of his
power through the steward of the manor. Now, though
the steward could not go against the customs of the
manor openly, there were many ways in which he could
make himself very disagreeable to the people under his
care. He was there to grind what he could out of the
tenants for the lord, and he took care to grind for himself
too. It seems to have been quite an understood thing
that he was to get what he could out of the manor for
himself, so that very often villeins and tenants had anything
but an easy, pleasant life.</p>

<p>The Norman Conquest did not interfere with the customs
of the manors, and the life of an ordinary manor
went on very much the same in King William's reign
as it had done under King Edward
the Confessor. About twenty years
after King William I had come to
the throne, that great survey, recorded
in Domesday Book, was made.
Learned men who have studied the
Domesday Book closely have discovered
many things connected with
the life of people in England at this
period. We can even see what parts
of the country suffered by opposing
King William, and which districts
had submitted quietly to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
In Norman Times: The Churches</h2>

<p>When we speak of Norman times we must bear in
mind that they lasted for over one hundred and thirty
years&mdash;say from 1066 to 1200. That period covers
a good many years, and consequently a good many
changes took place. Now this period is marked by a
particular style of architecture known as Norman or
Twelfth Century.</p>

<p>With the coming of William the Conqueror to England
began a great period of building in this country.
There was what we may almost call a "great rage" for
founding or establishing religious houses and churches,
and for building castles. All the religious houses have
gone, and nearly all the castles, but in their ruins we
can see specimens of Norman work. In a large number
of old churches we can see very good examples of this
style. In Hampshire especially there is scarcely one
old church, even in the most out-of-the-way village,
which has not some Norman work to show.</p>

<div><a name="norman_capital_buckland_church_berks" id="norman_capital_buckland_church_berks"></a></div>
<div class="image-left">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Norman Capital,<br /> Buckland
Church, Berks</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>You will expect to find that the style of building
altered somewhat during that long
time. In the beginning it was very
plain, but gradually it became more
ornamental. At first there were plain,
round-headed arches and heavy stone
pillars, with boldly cut caps to them.
But in the time of King Henry II,
and later, we find the mouldings of
the arches, and the caps of the pillars,
ornamented more and more with
bold carvings. There is a vast difference
between the plain, almost ugly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Norman work, in St. Alban's Cathedral,
which was begun about the year 1077,
and the Norman work which can be
seen in Durham Cathedral, or the west
door of Rochester Cathedral. The St.
Albans builders had no stone at hand
to speak of, but any amount of Roman
tiles from the ruins of Verulam. They
could not build anything very ornamental,
but they could and did build
something vast and imposing. In
most of the cathedrals there are still to

<p>We see, towards the end of the period, from the way
in which the Norman arches were used to intersect each
other and form two pointed arches within a round-headed
arch, that a change in style was showing itself.
Towards the end of Norman times, in the reigns of
Richard I and John, we reach what architects call the
Transition Period, when the Norman style was gradually
changing into the Early English or Pointed Style.
The choir of Canterbury Cathedral is one of the best-known
specimens of this Transition Period. Just as
changes took place in the style of the buildings, so,
too, the life of the nation changed. All the changes
were not improvements; some, indeed, were changes
for the worse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
Castles</h2>

<p>The passion for building castles in England had
begun before the Norman Conquest; but during the
Norman period a great many castles (about eleven
hundred, it is said) were built in various parts of the
country. They were not all of the same size, strength,
or importance. Some were royal castles, belonging to
the king, who placed each one in charge of a constable
or warden. These were necessary for the defence of
the country. We should expect to find important
castles, for instance, at such places as Carlisle, Ludlow,
Gloucester, Dover, and London. We can, too, trace
lines of castles along the Scottish and Welsh borders;
and there were no fewer than twenty-five in the county
of Monmouth alone.</p>

<p>Many castles were placed on the sites of Saxon strongholds,
and of strongholds dating from still earlier times.
Others were built where the overlord thought they
would be of service to him in protecting his interests
and keeping his tenants in order. So it often came to
pass that the castles were built close to, or in the very
heart of, a town or city. Frequently the castle was at
once the protection and the terror of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that some of the greatest castle-builders
of the time were bishops. There was Bishop
Gundulph of Rochester, who built the Keep of
Rochester Castle and the White Tower in the Tower
of London. There was Bishop Henry de Blois of
Winchester, who built a number of castles on lands
belonging to his bishopric. Strange as it may seem
to us that bishops should be great rulers and leaders
of armies, it did not strike the people of those days as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
at all extraordinary or improper. A bishop was as
much a ruler as the king, and had territories to look
after and keep in order. In those days he was quite
as able to carry out these duties as the boldest baron
of them all, and could give and take hard knocks with
the best of them.</p>

<div><a name="rochester_castle_the_keep" id="rochester_castle_the_keep"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Rochester Castle: The Keep</i></p>
<p><i>Rochester Castle was built by Bishop Gundulf between 1077 and 1108,
under the order of William Rufus. The magnificent Keep (70 feet square
and 104 feet high) was added about 1126.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The great castle-builders had no love for the traders
in towns and cities; indeed they looked down on that
class. But they found them very useful. Towns attracted
traders by land and by water; and every town,
every bridge, and every ferry belonged to some lord
or other. No goods could be brought into or taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
from a town, or carried across bridge or ferry, without
paying toll and custom to the overlord. But he had
certain duties to perform in return, in protecting the
town and its trade; and the better the protection the
more traders came to pay toll, and the better it was for
everybody concerned.</p>

<p>So we find, near many of our ancient towns and
cities, a castle, or its ruins&mdash;or perhaps only the site is
left&mdash;where the lord of the town kept a number of men
to protect the town and district, even when he was not
there himself.</p>

<p>If there was no love lost between the lord of the castle
and the townsmen, there was still less between the latter
and the soldiers. The soldiers were inclined to take
liberties, and to be insolent and oppressive. As they
had it in their power to "make trouble", if not kept in
good-humour, the townsmen put up with much for the
sake of peace and quietness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
Castles and Towns</h2>

<p>However useful a castle might be in protecting the
overlord's tenants and property, the sense of security
was always a great temptation to quarrel with other
lords. With strong kings, like William I and Henry I,
the danger of disorder was not so great, as these
monarchs knew how to keep their great barons in check.
But in the time of King Stephen, during the long years
of civil war, the barons were divided into two parties,
and each castle became a centre of strife.</p>

<p>The baron in his castle had his men to keep. These
he did not pay in regular wages. He fed, clothed, and
armed them after a fashion; and, to give them something
to do, would rake up some old grievance with a
neighbouring baron, make an attack upon his property,
and let his men plunder, burn, and kill to their hearts'
content. Then the other baron would retaliate.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the conditions of life in England
were most unsettled in the reign of King Stephen.
There was no safety in town or village, and the dwellers
on the manors must have suffered most severely. Their
own lord would send and gather in all their store to
victual his castle from time to time: his enemy would
send <em>his</em> men to seize what they could. It made very
little real difference to the villeins which side won; <em>they</em>
suffered, as they were heavily oppressed by both parties.
Their own lord expected his dues just the same, war or
no war, famine or no famine, whether he or his enemy
had carried off the best part of the corn and cattle or
not; and he would take his pick of the men on his
manors to fill the places of his men-at-arms who had
been put out of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Many of the barons became little better than monsters
of cruelty, and their castles "nests of devils and dens of
thieves". One of the very worst of these was Geoffrey
de Mandeville, who had large estates in Essex and Hertfordshire.
His castle of Anstey, in Hertfordshire, was
a den of fearful wickedness. He and his men neither
feared God nor regarded man; nothing was sacred to
them&mdash;they spared neither church nor monastery, town
nor village.</p>

<p>Dreadful tales are still told of the cruel deeds done
in the deep dungeons of nearly all these old castles by
the "bold bad barons" of the time of King Stephen.</p>

<p>When Henry II became king he put a stop to these
disorders, and large numbers of the castles were pulled
down; but the evils they had caused lived long after,
and were the source of much trouble.</p>

<p>It is said that "Everything comes to those who know
how to wait", and the townsmen, under the rule of a
great lord, knew how to wait. Great as the lord of the
town was, whether he was baron, bishop, or the king
himself, he could not do without the town&mdash;and the
town knew it. People were sometimes short of ready
money in those days just at the very time when they
needed it most urgently.</p>

<p>You will remember that the Crusades began in the
reign of King William I. Now and again the crusading
"fever" took hold of some of these Norman barons, and
many wanted to go to fight the Turk&mdash;especially when
there was not much fighting going on at home. But
crusading was a costly business, and of course there was
a good deal of rivalry between these crusading knights
as to who could raise the best-furnished troop of men.
The baron would be glad to get together as much
money as he could. So the chance came to many a
town to advance money to their lord. He, in return,
would grant to the town the right to collect the tolls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
customs payable to him for a term of years; or perhaps
on condition that they allowed him so much every year
out of the tolls collected.</p>

<p>Bishops, too, were often in urgent need of money, for
there were many calls upon them. The monasteries
were, at this period, beginning to do so much expensive
building, that often they, too, were glad to get money
by granting to the townsmen privileges for which they
were willing to pay.</p>

<div><a name="norman_castle" id="norman_castle"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Norman Castle (based on that of Coucy in the north of France). Coucy
(built between 1230-1242) was a magnificent example of a feudal fortress.
The "keep" was round instead of rectangular.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Then there were other towns, not depending so closely
on a baron or bishop or monastery, which wanted to
gain similar privileges of levying toll and custom.
These would petition the king for the right to be given
to them too, to levy dues, in return for a large sum of
money paid down, or for a yearly payment to the king.</p>

<p>The towns were becoming strong, and they gained
considerable rights during this Norman period. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
far back as the time of King Cnut we find, in some
districts, towns banding themselves together to protect
their trade and interests. This was the case with
Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Stamford, and Lincoln.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
In Norman Times: The Monasteries</h2>

<p>The hundred years after the Norman Conquest was a
great period of building. It was a time for establishing
or <em>founding</em> new religious houses. Something like three
hundred and ninety-eight such houses were opened during
this period, so that they played a very important part
in the history of the times. The Normans were not very
much interested in the English religious houses which
they found already established here. In fact, a good
many of them, since the times of the Danish invasion,
two hundred years before, had got into very bad order,
and were in need of reform. Little by little, as Norman
bishops and abbots were appointed over these Saxon
religious houses, reforms did take place, but not always
very easily or quietly.</p>

<p>At the time of the Conquest the religious houses in
Normandy were in a far better state than those in England.
Their members lived better lives, did better work,
and set a much better example of godly living and
working. There were several new orders or societies of
monks, which had their head-quarters on the continent
of Europe. These interested King William's companions
more than the old English monasteries, because
they and their fathers had helped to establish them.</p>

<p>So we find, as the Normans received lands here in
England, and founded religious houses, most of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
were connected with the monasteries across the sea, and
were ruled by abbots who lived across the sea. Such
branch houses were generally called priories, and the
kings and barons who founded them gave them manors
and parts of manors, sometimes taking them from the
older Saxon monasteries and cathedrals.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div><a name="ruins_of_furness_abbey" id="ruins_of_furness_abbey"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Ruins of Furness Abbey</i></p>
<p><i>Built about sixty years after the Norman Conquest. Much of it was
destroyed in the time of Henry VIII.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Then, too, there were the old Saxon houses, St. Alban's
Abbey, Westminster Abbey, and Glastonbury Abbey:
they were reformed and improved, and to them, too,
lands were given in various parts of the country, often
far away from the mother house. Thus St. Alban's
Monastery had important lands in the neighbourhood of
the River Tyne, and a daughter house was opened there
called Tynemouth Priory. So, you see, there were two
kinds of priories in England: one class attached to English
religious houses, and the other to Norman or foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
religious houses. In time the foreign priories received
the name of alien priories.</p>

<p>In time a good deal of ill-feeling arose towards these
alien priories, as the people in England did not like so
much money going out of the country, especially in war
times. King John was the first king to seize these
priories when he fell out with France. Later, King
Edward I, in 1295, seized the property of about one
hundred of the alien priories in various parts of England
to help to pay his war expenses. There were several of
these alien houses in the Isle of Wight, and, thinking
that the monks might be aiding his enemies across the
English Channel, the king sent the monks to other
houses on the mainland, a long way away from the coast,
to keep them out of mischief. When the war was over,
the property was restored to these priories, and the monks
returned to them. This kind of thing happened over and
over again.</p>

<p>All these religious houses had some interest in the
land, and all of them, to a greater or lesser degree, were
landlords. In some cases the lands given to them were
manors which had been managed and tilled in the same
way for hundreds of years. The only change was that
the lord of the manor might be a society or religious
house instead of a baron. Each of the manors had its
steward, its villeins, and so forth, like any other in the
land. But a good deal of the land given to these new
religious houses had never been occupied before.</p>

<p>Though some of the monasteries, like St. Alban's and
St. Edmund's Bury, were in towns, there were others,
especially those founded in these Norman times, far
away from towns, in pathless woods or deep dales, like
Rievaulx, in Yorkshire. Others, like Ramsey and
Thorney, were in lonely fens and marshes. Here the
monks themselves set to work, as in the earlier days,
and tilled the ground, keeping up their regular services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
in their little churches most carefully&mdash;praying and
working. Gradually their lands improved; other lands
came to them; more labour was needed; and so, little by
little, tenants took holdings on their lands, and farmed
them for the "house", on much the same conditions as
in the older manors.</p>

<div><a name="foundation_of_a_minster" id="foundation_of_a_minster"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Foundation of a Minster</i></p>
<p><i>From a thirteenth-century drawing in the British Museum.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>We find that in many of the monasteries attention was
given to other occupations besides agriculture. Some,
especially those in towns, like St. Alban's, became in
this period great seats of learning. All of them copied
the books they used, and some of them were particularly
famed for their writing and illuminating. In fact, they
were the book-producers of the age, and very little of the
work of learned ancient scholars could have come down
to us had it not been for the careful, painstaking work of
simple monks quite unknown to history.</p>

<p>Some of the abbeys in the west of England, like Bath
Abbey, had a good deal to do with opening up the wool
trade, which in the Middle Ages became the staple trade
of the south and west of England. Flaxley Abbey, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Gloucestershire, developed iron-smelting. The iron
mines in Furness were developed there by the monks,
and also in the neighbouring Walney Isle, off the Lancashire
coast. At Rievaulx, in Yorkshire, there were
ironworks near the abbey, and at Malvern Priory there
was ornamental tile-making carried on, specimens of the
work done there remaining in a good many Worcestershire
churches still. Monks gave great attention to their
gardens, and were very clever in fish culture; and in
many simple, homely ways they showed men how to
develop the natural resources of the land.</p>

<p>In the monasteries men could quietly think and work,
and use the talents they had, without being called away
to fight or do the unskilled work of the world. In these
early times there were no other places where men could
lead quiet, thoughtful lives, and "think things out", and
then put them into practice. The men in the monasteries
were not all equally good or religious or clever,
but the work done in and through these old institutions
was most important and most valuable to the country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
Early Houses</h2>

<p>When we go from a big modern manufacturing town
into an old town or village, we cannot help noticing the
old buildings, the ancient churches, the old town hall,
the alms-houses, and the old houses with their plastered
fronts, tiled roofs, and huge chimney-stacks.</p>

<p>As years go by, the number of these old houses gets
less and less. In the course of time, many of the smaller
ones especially, which have been neglected and allowed
to fall into bad repair, become dangerous to live in. The
sanitary inspector and the medical officer of health condemn
them as unfit for human habitation, and the houses
are shut up. Then, perhaps, they stand empty for some
years; mischievous boys throw stones and break the
glass left in the queer little windows; bill-posters paste
notices of all kinds on the doors, walls, and window-shutters;
holes are knocked in the plaster, bits of the
woodwork are torn away, chalk-marks are scrawled on
the walls, and the buildings very shortly look disgracefully
untidy. Then some day the "house-breaker"
appears on the scene, and the houses, which have
stood for centuries, are cleared away, and modern
buildings take their places.</p>

<p>Thoughtful people who know something of the history
of the town or village are always sorry to see old buildings
disappear; because there is much to be learned
from them, and they help us to recall many things
of great value and importance which we very easily lose
sight of.</p>

<p>But, old as the houses in our streets and villages are,
there are very few of them which date back more than
three hundred or three hundred and fifty years. Most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
them only date back to the time of Queen Elizabeth&mdash;the
latter part of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>There are, however, a number of fine old houses
which have work in them of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, and some people can point out to you
traces of work in some old houses of an earlier date
than that. There is at Lincoln, for instance, a fine
old stone house called "the Jew's House", which was
built late in the twelfth century. Of course, since it
was built, it has, from time to time, been altered to
suit the needs and the fancies of the various folk who
have lived in it. But stone houses for ordinary people,
both in towns and villages, were very rare then&mdash;wood
was the common material. Of course in parts of the
country where stone was plentiful, and wood scarce,
stone would be very largely used. For instance,
amongst the Cotswolds stone has always been the
handiest material for building walls, and for covering
roofs. In the course of centuries much of this stone has
been used over and over again, and has been "weathered"
into a very beautiful tone, such as only time can give.
Such old buildings are much loved and appreciated by
folk who have an eye to see the beauty of colouring.</p>

<p>Nowadays, both in town and country, houses are
commonly "bunches of bricks". The Romans knew
how to make bricks or tiles, and in places near old
Roman cities Roman tile is still to be seen, which has
been used up over and over again in the walls of old
buildings. The big tower of St. Alban's Cathedral is
built of Roman tiles which had been used centuries
before in the walls of Roman houses in Verulamium.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
That tower has been standing as it is now for over
eight hundred years.</p>

<p>But in Saxon times the <em>art</em> of brick-making was
lost, and Saxons and Normans, it appears, were quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
ignorant of it. There is an old brick house&mdash;Little
Wenham Hall, in Suffolk&mdash;which is believed to have
been built in the latter part of the thirteenth century.
That is the oldest brick house in England. In the
fifteenth century the art of brick-making had been rediscovered,
and it seems to have been imported from
Flanders. We find specimens of such brickwork in
places near the east coast, and this old brickwork is
more pleasing to the eye than our modern brick. Here,
again, time has done its work in beautifying. The
old palace at Hatfield is one of the brick buildings of
this period; but brick did not come much into use until
quite a century later. In the county of Middlesex,
where there is found clay which is very suitable for
brick-making, the art was not used to any great extent
till the time of King James I. After the Great Fire of
London, in the year 1666, there was a great demand for
bricks, and the use of that material has quite changed
the character of the houses in our towns and villages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
Early Houses (<i>Cont.</i>)</h2>

<p>For many centuries the houses of the villeins and
cottiers did not alter very much in their general plan.
You will remember that in those old pit-dwellings the
hearth and its fire were the centre of the home. The
room, or space round the fire, gradually became larger,
especially in the houses of the thanes and eorls, till we
get the hall, with the hearth in the middle and the hole
in the roof to let out the smoke.</p>

<p>All through the later Saxon and Danish times, and
in the Norman period, the hall was the most important
part of the house. As the years went on, and the style
of building altered, the walls, the windows, and the
roof became more beautiful and ornamental, becoming
most magnificent in the fourteenth century, or Decorated
Period. Gradually other buildings were added to the
hall for comfort and convenience.</p>

<div><a name="diagram_of_the_shape_of_a_villeins_house" id="diagram_of_the_shape_of_a_villeins_house"></a></div>
<div class="image-left">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Diagram of the Shape of a Villein's House</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>So far as we know, the house or hut of the villein was
a very simple affair before the time of the Norman Conquest.
Two pairs of poles were set up, sloped, and
joined at the top, and connected by a ridge pole as
shown in the illustration. The space between was then
filled in by other poles and wattle-work. This was plastered
with clay, and covered with turf or rough thatch.
There seems to have been a pretty regular length for
this building, which
was long enough to
take four stalls for
oxen. That required
about sixteen feet
and was called a
"bay". The villein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and his oxen were all housed under one roof at first.
When another bay was added, the size of the house was
doubled, and so on. In the course of time the houses
were improved; side walls were raised of wood framing,
and the sides were filled in with wattle and covered with
clay.</p>

<div><a name="the_old_palace_hatfield" id="the_old_palace_hatfield"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p>THE OLD PALACE, HATFIELD</p>
<p>[See page <a href="#Page_71">71</a>]]</p>
</div></div>

<p>As the years went on, these houses or huts grew out
of date, and were replaced by others in much the same
style, but gradually improving in comfort and workmanship.
In the villages there was not much alteration
down to the fourteenth century. When a house in a
manor or village was pulled down, and was to be rebuilt,
the manor court kept a sharp eye upon the building
operations to see that the new walls did not encroach
upon the highway, or upon the lord's land. No addition
could be made to the house without the consent of the
overlord. Customs in the villages changed very, very
slowly, and so it is that, though the houses in out-of-the-way
villages have been rebuilt over and over again,
there are many lath-and-plaster houses standing now
round village greens, built between two and three
hundred years ago, on old foundations which date back
to Saxon times.</p>

<p>We gave as an instance on p. 26 the case of Exton,
in Rutland. There the houses even to-day, in spite of
the fact that they have often been rebuilt and somewhat
modified in the course of centuries, occupy the same
sites as they did in Saxon times. No one would dream
of laying out a village on those lines to-day, and in the
great changes which we know are greatly needed in
housing all over the country, and which are bound to
affect every village in the land more or less and to
change the whole aspect of these old-world villages, it
will be well if some <em>specimens</em>, at least, can be preserved
to us, so that those yet to come may be able to see how
our ancestors for many generations were housed. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the health of the people will have to be safeguarded
most carefully, and much of that which is old will have
to give place to that which is new.</p>

comfortless place. Even as late as the time of Queen
Elizabeth a countryman's house is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
Early Town Houses</h2>

<p>Houses in towns have been more frequently rebuilt
and altered in various ways than those in the villages.
The chief material used in building was wood, as it was
in the villages, and one of the great dangers in the
Middle Ages was that of fire. In the towns this danger
was greater than in the villages, and fires happened
more frequently.</p>

<p>The leading men in a town had more money to spend,
and the increase of business, or a desire for change, led
them to improve their houses. It was easier for a wealthy
townsman to get leave from the "corporation", or guild
which ruled the town, to rebuild his house than it was
for the villein in the village to get the leave of the
manor court.</p>

<p>The thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries all
saw a great growth in architecture; they were the Early
English, the Decorated, and the Perpendicular Periods
of architecture. In most of the old churches, and in
many of the old mansions, we have specimens of all
these periods; but not very many of the town houses
founded in the Middle Ages, and still standing, are
much earlier than the fifteenth century. In that age
there was a great development of woodwork, and there
is hardly one old town which has not some woodwork
of that time in some of its old houses.</p>

<p>The rich and prosperous townsman rebuilt his house
according to the fashion of his time; but through all
the three centuries the general arrangements of the
dwelling-house did not alter very much.</p>

<p>In some parts of London, and in many country towns,
you can see that some of the very old-fashioned shops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
in the main street are reached from the pavement by a
little flight of steps. Below the shop there is a big light
cellar, and the small boy or girl who wants to look in at
the shop window has to "tiptoe" very much in order
to do so. Now, that arrangement is just a little relic
of the old town house of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The house was usually quite narrow, and had a gable
facing the street. It was built over a cellar of stone, often
arched and vaulted very much like a church. There
were steps from the street down to the cellar, and these
steps had to be protected, or accidents were certain to
happen to careless foot-passengers. Then, too, there
were steps up to the room over the cellar, which formed
the shop and workroom in one. The front of the shop
would be open, like a stall, and there would probably be
a passage through to the back of the house.</p>

<p>Above the shop would be another room or rooms, over
which, in the open space under the roof, was the great
attic running through the house. This attic was often
kept as a store-room, and goods were hoisted from the
street by a crane; but in later times it would be formed
most likely into little sleeping-rooms, very small, very,
dark, and very unhealthy. Very often they led one into
the other, and had no windows or means of proper
ventilation.</p>

<p>Most of the work would be done in the shop, where
the master, his workmen, and apprentices all did their
share. The apprentices would sleep in the shop at night,
and very probably the workmen as well. It was quite
a usual thing for all the establishment to work and live
and sleep on the premises. The rooms occupied by the
master and his family at first were few in number;
separate bedrooms only came into use very gradually
indeed.</p>

<p>The walls of the house above the cellar were usually
of wood, and the front towards the street was often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
skilfully and beautifully carved. In some English
counties still there are very fine specimens of these old
town houses; those at Chester, Shrewsbury, and Ludlow,
for instance, are famed all over the world.</p>

<div><a name="shop_of_the_middle_ages_now_standing_in_foregate_street_chester" id="shop_of_the_middle_ages_now_standing_in_foregate_street_chester"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Shop of the Middle Ages now standing in Foregate Street, Chester</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>We must not suppose that all the houses were equally
splendid, or equally well built; there was then, no doubt,
bad building as well as good. In fact there must have
been some very careless building in early days, and
especially so in Norman times. It is a curious fact that
almost every big Norman church tower tumbled down
because it was badly built, even though Norman work
looked very massive and substantial, and was very
imposing.</p>

<p>Merchants and wealthy tradesmen took great pride in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
their houses, and the woodwork and furniture in them
were splendid. Kings and nobles were no better housed
than these wealthy townsmen, nor did they have more
of the comforts of life.</p>

<p>But the poor! There were always the poor and the
outcast in every town; but they did not exist in the
enormous numbers of later years, or of the present day.
Their wretched little hovels were huddled together in
close alleys, and life in them must have been very cheerless
and unwholesome. It was, however, <em>somebody's</em>
business to look after them. The religious houses, the
churches, the colleges, all did their part in distributing
food at their gates daily. Many wealthy people, both
nobles and citizens, did likewise, and to give alms to
the poor was a work of charity which no self-respecting
citizen thought of shirking. Then, too, the guild or
corporation kept a sharp look-out upon the poor;
strangers were turned out of the town, and the people
punished who had taken them into their houses without
having the consent of the town authorities. In old town
records we often come across instances of people being
punished for "harbouring inmates".</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
Life in the Towns of the Middle Ages</h2>

<p>Disease was one of the great dangers always lurking
in a town. Plague of some kind or other was never
very far away, and it frequently made its presence
felt. People had not realized the sinfulness of dirt.</p>

<p>The best-drained buildings were the monasteries and
colleges. Near the ruins of every big monastery, from
time to time, underground passages have been discovered,
many of them big enough for a man to walk
along upright, and leading nobody knows where. When
these were found, people shook their heads and said:
"Ah, those old monks; you don't know what they were
up to! They made these secret passages, going for
miles and miles underground, so that they might get
in and out of the monastery, and be up to all sorts
of mischief, without anyone being the wiser."</p>

<p>Many wonderful tales have been told about these
underground passages; but, as a matter of fact, most,
if not all of them, have turned out to be sewers, which
the monks made from their monasteries to a watercourse
some distance away, so that the sewage might
be safely got rid of. The monks were usually in
advance of the townsmen of those days in sanitary
matters. No doubt a sanitary engineer of the present
day would be able to point out how much better the
drainage-works could have been carried out; but the
monks set an example in this matter which, bit by
bit, the rest of the nation began to follow.</p>

<p>The chief streets of the town and the market-place
were paved with huge lumps of stone, sloping towards
the middle of the street from the houses on each side
of the way, a gutter or "denter" running down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
middle. All sorts of filth were flung into the gutter,
for there were no drains from the houses in early days.
When a heavy shower of rain fell, the water flushed
the gutter more or less. If the street happened to be
pretty level, the gutter, or denter, was just an open
sewer all the year round; and it did its deadly work
in poisoning the worthy citizens, though they did not
realize it. Those towns were the best drained which
were perched on a steep slope, so that the contents of
the gutter found their way speedily to the nearest watercourse.
By that means they got rid of <em>some</em> of the filth,
but they did not improve the watercourse.</p>

<p>There were no great manufacturing towns in those
days. Most of the ordinary articles used by the townsfolk
were manufactured in the town itself, and much
of the work went on in the open air. The butcher
killed his animals in the street, before his shop, and
that added to the horrors and stenches of the gutter.
But then all the butchers in a town were located in
one part of it. Even now most old towns have got
a Shambles, or Butchers' Row, or Butchery Street,
or place of similar name, near the market-place. Other
trades had their own parts of the town, where they made
and sold their goods. Cordwinder Street or Shoemakers'
Row are still common street names. The
smith and the armourer did much of their work out
in the open street; the joiner put together there any
big piece of woodwork which he had in hand; the
wheel-wright "shut" his tyres; the chandler melted
fat and made candles. The streets of the town must
have been very noisy and very "smelly".</p>

<p>There were no footways for passengers. Wagons,
drays, and wheel-barrows there were, but carriages
had hardly been invented, and coaches and light-wheeled
vehicles had not been dreamt of. Travellers
mostly went on horses or mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<div><a name="the_shambles_york_a_street_that_preserves_its_narrow_mediaeval_character" id="the_shambles_york_a_street_that_preserves_its_narrow_mediaeval_character"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>The Shambles, York; a street that preserves its narrow, mediæval character</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>No doubt the tradesmen were expected to clear up
the mess they made in front of their houses, and
the apprentices had to sweep up. But that usually
meant only drawing the rubbish together to the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
refuse-heap close to the house, which the fowls and
the pigs, to say nothing of the children, speedily
managed to scatter. Now and then the town authorities
would wake up and make a fuss, and these heaps would
be carted away to a spot outside the town; but usually
the street was looked upon as the handiest place into
which to fling any refuse from the houses. However
clean the citizens' houses might be inside, and however
richly ornamented the woodwork and the furniture,
plague and pestilence were always very near.</p>

<p>Still, though many persons died, and were buried
close by in the little churchyard, where for hundreds
of years the dead had been buried, people lived, and
throve, and did good work. For one thing, they lived
a great deal in the open air, and they were not so much
afraid of draughts in their houses as we are.</p>

<p>The water-supply of a town was a very important
matter. Here, again, the monasteries and colleges frequently
led the way, and showed how water might be
brought by pipes from a distant spring. It was not an
uncommon thing for water to be brought in this way
to a "conduit" in the market-place, whence the people
fetched it as they needed. Many a good wealthy citizen
has performed the pious work of providing his town
with a supply of water. Parts of old water-pipes, some
of wood and some of lead, laid for such a purpose, have
often been discovered in recent years.</p>

<p>Usually, however, a town had to depend upon wells
for its water-supply, and water drawn from the nearest
stream; and with open gutters running through the
town it is very easy to see that many of these wells
supplied water which, at times, could not have been
pure, however bright and clear it may have looked,
and it could never be relied upon as really fit for
drinking purposes.</p>

<p>In the villages the dangers arising from want of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
proper drainage and from impure water were not quite
so great as in the towns. Yet even now, in this
twentieth century, how to drain our villages properly,
and provide them with a good water-supply, is an
urgent problem in many places. For many years
people have realized that the evil exists, but we have
been slow to apply the right remedy because of the
expense. And the nation has greatly suffered in
health in consequence. We have seen that the houses
in the villages were usually close together, and men
had not realized that dirt is one of the greatest enemies
of mankind. There are a good many people, even in
our time, who see no great harm in having pigsties,
refuse-heaps, and manure-heaps close to their houses.</p>

<p>One of the most loathsome of the diseases common
in Norman times and later was leprosy. The lepers
were kept out of the towns, but at first very little was
done for them. The refuse of the markets, and the
food that was so bad that it had to be carted outside the
town, was thought to be good enough for them. Gradually,
however, we find hospitals for lepers established.
They were not what we understand by hospitals, places
where sick folk could be doctored and nursed and cured;
they were religious houses which poor lepers might
enter, and in which they might have safe shelter, care,
and attention for the rest of their sad lives. They were
always built outside the walls of the towns.</p>

<p>Other hospitals for poor and suffering people were
also established. They were not large buildings, with
wards holding scores of people. They were little religious
houses, each with its chapel and priests to carry
on its services, providing homes for small numbers&mdash;perhaps
half a dozen or a dozen. Almost every town
had a number of these hospitals.</p>

<p>Kings, bishops, earls, and citizens all took part in
this good work. Every founder expected that every day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
"for ever" he and his family should be prayed for by
the inmates. Some hospitals were "founded" or established
as thank-offerings for escape from some great
danger; some to "make up" for some wrong that had
been done and could never be put right, and to show
that the founder was "really sorry"; some were built
for good reasons, others for selfish reasons. Nowadays
we arrange fêtes and demonstration, whist drives, entertainments,
bazaars, sales of work, jumble sales, dances,
for our hospital funds, Red Cross funds, and orphan
funds, and we are asked to buy tickets because "it's a
good cause". We get some enjoyment for ourselves and
help the hospital; thus, as it were, doing good and receiving
good at the same time. We need not look down
upon our ancestors as being merely selfish creatures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
The Growing Power of the Towns</h2>

<p>Back in early Saxon times we find that the inhabitants
of a town were banded together to keep the peace,
thus forming a society pledged to each other&mdash;the Peace
or Frith Guild. It lost nearly all its <em>real</em> power in later
Saxon and Norman times. But it did not actually die
out, and it appears that from this Frith Guild what we
now understand by a corporation took its rise. The
guild was a great power in some of the Saxon towns;
only those belonging to it could trade in the town, and
its members were very slow to admit outsiders to share
in their privileges.</p>

<p>We have seen that the free, or nearly free, tuns gradually
came under the power of an overlord&mdash;the king, a
bishop, a baron, or a monastery, as the case might be&mdash;and
very little real power was left to the guild. The
overlord appointed a reeve to look after his interests,
and the government of the place was in his hands. Yet
the old Frith Guild seems to have regulated matters connected
with the <em>customs</em> of the town, which did not interfere
with the lord's rights.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Seal of Guild Merchant, Gloucester, 1200.</i><br />
<i>The city gates are represented in the centre.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>When we reach Norman
times we have come to a
period during which the
towns improved their position.
The Norman Conquest
led to increased trade
with the Continent. The
great building operations
here attracted skilled workmen
and craftsmen to this
country. These men naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
found their way to the towns rather than to the
villages. They were protected and encouraged by the
Norman nobles, who preferred <em>their</em> work to that of the
Saxons. Although they might be foreigners, these
strangers had ideas of freedom and liberty which fitted
in very well with the town's ideas of self-government.
Then, too, these craftsmen were bound together in
trade societies or guilds, and that made them strong
and worthy of consideration in the places where they
settled.</p>

<p>A charter to a town granted and secured to it certain
privileges, and a town with a charter became a borough
town. The king granted a good many charters to towns
during the Norman period. A town which wished to get
a charter had to pay heavily for it. But it was quite worth
while for the town to secure the right which a charter
gave it&mdash;the right to manage its own affairs. What a
town most desired was to be free from the authority of
the king's officer, to choose its own port-reeve, who
could preside over the court of the town, so that the
town might not have to appear before the hundred court.
By paying an annual rent to the king, however heavy
the amount might be, the town hoped to escape from the
many extra fees and taxes which the king's officers put
upon it. It could then settle its own disputes, raise its
own taxes as it needed them, and punish its own evil-doers.</p>

<p>In many cases bishops, barons, or religious houses
were the overlords of districts containing important
towns, and those towns managed to get charters from
their overlords as other towns had from the king. By so
doing they could get out of the power of the sheriff or
shire-reeve. Charter or borough towns have most of
them been very particular to preserve their rights and
privileges.</p>

<p>If you live in a small country borough town, or a city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
you will notice that two different benches of magistrates
sit in the town-hall to hear police cases; and there are
two different courts of justice, though held often in the
same room. There are first of all the Borough Sessions,
at which the mayor of the borough presides, and which
deal with cases arising in the borough, whether trifling
or serious. Then, on another fixed day in the week, in
the very same building, another body or bench of
magistrates sits. These gentlemen usually come in from
country places outside the town, and the cases brought
before them have to do with the mischief done in the
villages and country parishes. These magistrates have
nothing at all to do with offences committed within the
borough. These are the county magistrates, and their
court is called the Petty Sessions, or the County
Sessions.</p>

<p>Some offences are too grave for the borough or county
magistrates to settle, and they have to be tried by a
higher court of justice, which has greater powers than
the Court of Petty Sessions&mdash;the Court of Quarter
Sessions. The bench of this court is made up of magistrates
drawn from all parts of the county, and a jury of
twelve men, householders, from different parts of the
county, has to be sworn to hear the evidence in the cases
to be tried. The jury decides whether the man is
proved to be guilty or not, when they have heard all
that can be urged for and against him, and the magistrates
decide what his punishment is to be, according to
law.</p>

<p>There are some cases too grave or too complicated for
the Court of Quarter Sessions to decide, and these have
to stand over to the Assizes. These Assizes are held
three times a year in the county town of each county,
and every prisoner in the county jail must be accounted
for. The court is presided over by one or more of the
king's judges. These are trained lawyers, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
attend in the king's place, and are treated with much
pomp and ceremony.</p>

<p>The sheriff of the county, properly attended, must
meet the judge or judges upon arrival. Formerly when
judges on circuit travelled by road from one county town
to the next county town, the sheriff of the assize town to
which they were travelling met them some distance from
the town with a band of horsemen in quaint, old-time
uniforms, armed with javelins; and in a similar way
attended them for some distance out of the town when
the assize was over. In most places the javelin men
have disappeared, or nearly disappeared, and this guard
of honour is supplied by mounted policemen. But
there are a good many quaint old customs and ceremonies
still observed in connection with the holding of
the assizes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
The Villages, Manors, Parishes,<br />
and Parks</h2>

<p>We have seen that in Norman times the whole country
was, so to speak, the king's. There were the great lords
who held "fiefs" or possessions directly from the king,
which consisted of manors in various parts of the country&mdash;sometimes
a number of manors pretty close together,
but often with big stretches of unoccupied land between
them over which the king had full control. Out of
these unused districts the king could, and often did
make new grants of land.</p>

<p>As years rolled on, the manors became more valuable,
and new manors were formed. In the earlier days the
manor and the parish meant much the same thing; but
in course of time, though the boundaries of the parish
did not alter much, the number of manors increased
in some parishes from one to two or three, or even
more.</p>

<p>In many cases the mode of life on these manors went
on unchanged for centuries, the tenants of these different
manors going to the original parish church and the
parish priest ministering to the people in all the manors
in his parish. In other cases daughter churches, or
chapels of ease, were built in the newer manors, and
provision was made for the support of a priest to minister
to them. These have in some instances been erected in
the course of time into separate parishes; but many
remained as parts of the mother parish, though they
might be several miles away from the parish church.</p>

<p>All through the Norman times there was a tendency
to make new manors, and this gave rise to so many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
difficulties that the practice was stopped in the time of
King Edward I.</p>

<p>In all parts of England to-day we have parks belonging
to big mansions; and our big towns and cities have
their parks too; but these are usually recreation-grounds
for the people, and most of them are quite modern, with
bandstands and sports' grounds, clumps of shrubs,
flower-beds, and stretches of greensward. A park in
Norman and in Early English times was very different
in appearance from our parks, whether in town or
country. Just as the king had his great forests for hunting
wild beasts, so in the later Norman times the great
lords were anxious to enclose pieces of waste and forest
land for the same purpose.</p>

<p>As we have seen, there were in early times vast tracts
of wild, uncultivated, unenclosed land, partly wooded
and partly heath land, between the manors, which
belonged to the king. The king alone could give leave
to make a park. In the reign of King Henry III especially
we find many such parks were "empaled". Of
course the nobles had to give something to the king for
this privilege.</p>

<p>Many of the old parks in England, now celebrated for
their fine timber and beautiful scenery, date back to this
period; but they were at first much wilder, and the trees
then were neither so many nor so fine as they are now.
The deer remaining in some of them to-day just serve to
remind us of the "wild beasts" with which they were
stocked.</p>

<p>The laws for preserving the wild beasts and the game
in these parks and forests and chases were very strict,
harsh, and severe. Many of these new parks took away
from the villeins, who lived in the neighbourhood,
certain rights and privileges which their forefathers had
had "time out of mind".</p>

<p>Though the land could not be bought and sold outright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
manors became divided and subdivided, let and
underlet, for various terms of years, and in many
curious ways, so that in time the profits, or the income,
of a manor, instead of going straight to the lord of the
manor, might be going to half a dozen different persons
and places. For instance, the half of a manor
might be divided amongst several people for, say,
twenty years, or for the lives of three or four people;
but at the end of the twenty years, or on the death of the
last of those persons, it must go back to the lord of the
manor, who could keep it in his hands or let it out in
other ways to quite a different set of people.</p>

<p>It is not very difficult to understand that the management
of an estate of many manors, broken up into many
small portions, became very complicated. Records of
all these various transactions had to be made in writing:
and carefully kept, and copied and re-copied time after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
time. People who understood all the "ins and outs" of
the laws relating to the possession of land became very
important and very busy.</p>

<p>There are immense numbers of documents, some of
them dating back to Norman and even earlier times,
still in existence. The Record Office, in London, has
many thousands of documents connected with the king's
business; the borough towns and cities and the monasteries
each had their own records, but most of these
latter records disappeared in the sixteenth century;
every old estate has such documents; and many of the
old manors have still records going back many centuries.
Of course thousands more of these old documents have
been lost, some destroyed purposely, and others through
carelessness and ignorance. Some have been burnt in
times of danger, when their owner, knowing that there
were documents amongst them which might get him
into trouble and cost him his head, set fire to bundles
of papers and parchments. Others have been stored
away in dark, damp cellars and forgotten for years and
years, and rats and mice have nibbled them away, or
mildew and damp have caused them to rot.</p>

<p>Those that we have left can still be read, and it is
surprising to find in many cases how well they have
been preserved all through the centuries. The letters
are very often beautifully formed, and the whole clear
and distinct. They were written in Norman French and
Latin, the latter being the language in which law business
was carried on for many centuries.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
Traces of Early Times in the<br />
Churches</h2>

<p>In most villages the church is the chief old building
in the place, and it is a good thing to be able to tell the
time to which its different parts belong. It will help us
to fix in our minds the different periods, or steps, in the
history of our country.</p>

<p>A little party of holiday-makers were one day strolling
through a country churchyard in which was a very old
church. They were not much interested until one of
the party saw in the wall of the church a slab to "an
honest carpenter", dated 1765. "How very, very old!"
he exclaimed, and called the attention of his companions
to it, and they all wondered and marvelled. Yet in that
same wall were bits of work which belonged to a past
age, not just a hundred or so years back, but a thousand
years back. They had not been trained to read "the
signs of the times".</p>

<p>Never be ashamed to ask questions about an old building.
It will be a very strange thing indeed if you cannot
find, in every town and village, <em>somebody</em> who has
a keen interest in old buildings and who will delight in
pointing them out to you. Nearly every local newspaper
in the country, from time to time, prints odds and ends
connected with the history of the neighbourhood. If
there is anything about an old building that you want
explained, you can easily write a short letter to the editor
of the paper, and there is sure to be someone who will
take the trouble to answer your question, and help you
to understand, and to distinguish between things "that
differ".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
An old parish church has a good deal to tell us about
the history of the parish and its people, and if you know
something of the history of the place in which you live
you will know something <em>worth knowing</em> of the history
of your country, which will help you to be a good
citizen. But this knowledge can only be picked up
little by little, and you cannot learn "all about it" in
the course of a few days.</p>

<p>There are, as we said in a former chapter, some few
churches which have little bits of Saxon work left in
their walls and windows. In a great many more we
shall see some Norman work, especially in pillars and
arches and doorways. That Norman Period takes in the
reigns of all the kings from William I to the time of
King John, from the middle of the eleventh century to
the end of the twelfth, down to the time of Magna Carta.</p>

<p>When we come to the time of Magna Carta we are in
the thirteenth century, when pointed arches came into
use. Through the reigns of King Henry III and King
Edward I a great deal of building in that style went on.
In almost every parish some alteration was made in the
church in that century; and probably in the chancel
there are one or two old window's which will be pointed
out to you as having been first put in during that
century.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>You may perhaps find a very old battered figure of a
man in chain armour, the sort of armour in which King
Edward I went fighting in the Third Crusade, in Wales,
and in Scotland; in which Simon de Montfort and
Wallace and the Bruce fought. Some of these effigies
have the legs crossed&mdash;some at the ankles, some at the
knees, and some at the thighs. It used to be said that
these represented crusaders; but nobody seems really to
know what was the meaning of the cross-legged effigies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Then there are some flat stones, lying in the pavement,
with inscriptions running round the edge in
strange worn letters, with perhaps an ornamental cross
also cut the whole length of the stones. These are the
cover-stones of the graves where some great baron or
landowner was buried, and they belong to the thirteenth
century, and some are even of earlier date. They are
called incised slabs.</p>

<p>In this same century another kind of cover-stone for a
grave came into use, especially in the southern and
eastern parts of England. Metal was fixed in the
incised slabs, and the portrait of the knight and his
lady, the merchant or the lawyer, the bishop or priest,
was engraved on the metal, showing the person in the
kind of dress worn during life. It is said that there
are about four thousand of these brasses still left in
England. Some of them have been sadly damaged
and worn. They do not all belong to the thirteenth
century, as this kind of memorial of the dead was used
during several centuries&mdash;in fact, well on into Queen
Elizabeth's reign, at the end of the sixteenth century.
The oldest brass in England, showing a man in armour,
is in Surrey, in Stoke D'Abernon church. Brasses
are very valuable, as they show us the kinds of armour
and dress worn in particular centuries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
Traces of Early Times in the<br />
Churches (<i>Cont.</i>)</h2>

<p>The fourteenth century is covered by the reigns of
King Edward II, King Edward III, and King Richard II.
The architecture became much more ornamental, and
there is a good deal of fine stone-carving.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Many
beautiful window-heads and doorways belong to this
period. A good many aisles were added to the old
naves; many of the old Norman towers were rebuilt
and crowned with graceful spires; but the work is not
all equally good.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the most beautiful spires are
very frequently met with in districts that are flat and
destitute of the natural beauty which mountains and
hills, valleys and woodlands, give to a landscape; and it
looks as if the people in different parishes had tried to
outdo their neighbours in erecting graceful spires on
their church towers.</p>

<p>There are a great many tombs in the churches in
various parts of the country, and much money was spent
upon them in this and in the next century. They are
raised some two or three feet from the ground; the sides
are divided into panels and ornamented with rich carvings
and shields of arms, brilliantly coloured and gilded. On
the top of the tombs are to be seen effigies carved in
stone of the man and his wife, lying on their backs,
with hands clasped. The men are usually in armour,
and their wives in the dress of the time, with strange-looking
head-dresses. Many of the effigies are much
defaced and battered, but there are others of them well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
preserved still. It was in the latter part of the fourteenth
century that great attention began to be paid to shields
of arms, and heraldry became an important science.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the fourteenth century, during
the reign of King Edward III, there came a time of
great distress. There were the long years of war with
France, years of famine and the Black Death. That
meant a period of great distress for the country; all
classes suffered, and there was much discontent and
disorder. These bad times left their marks upon the
buildings, especially upon the churches. In some
churches work can be pointed out to you which was
begun before the time of the Black Death on a grand
scale, but finished off in a much plainer manner&mdash;apparently
years after it was begun. The work had
been started, but bad times stopped it, and it had to
wait. Those who had begun it never saw it finished,
for the pestilence carried them away; and, long afterwards,
those who did finish it were not well enough off
to carry out the design as it was at first intended.</p>

<p>Still, all through these centuries much was spent on
the churches, not only by the great nobles, not only in
monastery buildings and the cathedral churches, but on
the ordinary town and village churches as well.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>The wealthy wool-merchants, especially in the fourteenth
century, spent much on the building and decoration
of churches. Some of the finest churches in the
eastern and western counties of England owe much to
them. Then, too, it was quite a common thing for the
various trade guilds in a town to have a little chapel, or
an aisle, or an altar in the parish church, which the guild
undertook to keep up. One guild tried to outdo the
others in this matter. All the craftsmen of those days
belonged to a trade guild of some sort, and much good
artistic work was done, which found a place in the
churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
People took a keen interest in their
churches, and we find them leaving
money towards their upkeep, towards
making a statue, or doing some carving,
or even keeping a light burning. Whatever
may have been their reasons for
so doing, the fact that they did so is
very clear.</p>

<p>They used their churches in ways that
may seem strange to us; but they looked
upon them as their own, and were evidently
in many cases proud of them.
Each parish annually chose its churchwardens,
who had charge of the buildings
and the furniture, and these were
responsible to the bishop, as well as to
the people of the parish. Every now
and then the bishop visited the parish,
or sent someone to do so in his name.
Enquiry was made as to how the priest
and the people carried out their duties
towards each other. Complaints were
heard, and attempts made to set matters
right. Some of the reports which were
made on such occasions have come down
to us, and show often much disorder,
and at times much that was evil. But
we must not forget that good was also being done then,
which was not talked much about.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />
Clerks</h2>

<p>Changes took place much more slowly in the Middle
Ages than they do now. First of all, the population was
very much smaller, and hundreds and hundreds of acres
now covered by big manufacturing towns were then unoccupied
land.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest the whole population
of England only numbered about two million
people; and in the time of King Henry VII it was only
four millions; so that in the course of four hundred years
the population had only doubled itself.</p>

<p>The people were not crowded into the towns. For
instance, in the time of King Edward III, Colchester
was one of the large towns, yet it had only three hundred
and fifty houses, in which three thousand people lived,
all told. There were only nine larger towns in the
country at that time.</p>

<p>The bulk of the people were living in the villages, in
the various manors, not in the towns. Many things
prevented the population from growing very rapidly&mdash;disease,
famine, and war kept it down. Death was the
punishment for a very large number of offences, so that
it is not to be wondered at that the population did not
increase very fast.</p>

<p>The population was divided into two distinct classes&mdash;those
who were clergy, or clerks, and those who were not.
By "clergy" we understand, in these days, "ministers
of religion"; but the word had a very different meaning
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In early Saxon times religion and learning were very
closely related. Colleges and monasteries were centres
of learning, and bishops, abbots, priests, and monks took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the lead in matters in which a knowledge of reading and
writing was required. Folk who had a leaning towards
learning naturally became connected with colleges or
monasteries. They began as scholars, and then were
admitted, or ordained, to one of the lower orders of the
ministry&mdash;often when they were still only boys.</p>

<div><a name="a_scriptorium_from_a_miniature_painted_in_an_old_manuscript" id="a_scriptorium_from_a_miniature_painted_in_an_old_manuscript"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>A Scriptorium, from a miniature painted in an old manuscript (written in
1456) in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It depicts a clerk writing.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>There are many thousands of boys to-day who are
choir-boys. In early times those admitted to such an
office as that had to be ordained, or set apart for the
purpose, by the bishop. That ordaining made them
clerks or clergy; and they were then under the authority
of the bishop or his officers. If they did wrong, they
were tried and punished in the bishop's court.</p>

<p>In the course of years there grew up, side by side, two
different set of courts of justice, the Church Courts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the King's Courts, which were each guided by different
laws. The laws which ruled the Church Courts were
much more merciful than those which ruled the civil or
King's Courts. Death was the punishment for almost
every offence tried in the King's Courts and in the
Manor Courts; but in the Church Courts the punishments
were much less severe, and the culprit had a
much better chance of "turning over a new leaf".</p>

<p>If a man was brought before the King's Court
charged with a crime, he could call for a book. If he
could read a few sentences, that was taken to show
that he was a clerk, and he could claim to be tried by
the Church Court. That is, he could claim "benefit
of clergy".</p>

<p>You can readily see that such a state of things, however
good it may have been at the first, was dreadfully
abused in the course of time. What at first had been
merciful and just became in time mischievous and dangerous.
The great struggle between King Henry II
and Archbishop Thomas à Becket had to do with the
power of these two sets of courts, the King's Courts
and the Church Courts&mdash;it had to do with government,
<em>not</em> with religion and religious matters.</p>

<p>Clerks, or the clergy, were drawn from all classes of
society, from the royal family down to the serfs on the
manors. In fact, before the time of the Black Death,
the only way in which a serf could become a freeman
was by buying his freedom or by becoming a clerk.
A serf who wanted his son to rise to a better position
than his own would try to get him made a clerk; for the
moment he became a clerk he was a free man. But to
attain his purpose the serf must first have the permission
of his master or overlord. All overlords were not tyrants
by any means. The serf might do his master a good
turn&mdash;save his life, for instance&mdash;and in return his master
would set him free, or allow his son to be taught by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
priest and ordained; or he might let him join a college
or monastery.</p>

<p>Many and many a priest, clerk, or monk rose from
being a serf or a villein in this way; so many, in fact,
that a writer in the twelfth century complains that villeins
were attempting "to educate their ignoble offspring".
Later still, Piers Plowman complains that "bondsmen's
bairns could be made bishops".</p>

<p>There was a very sharp line of division between clerks
and those who were not clerks, and the privileges which
clerks had, led to much squabbling and many disorders.</p>

<p>Kings and nobles employed clerks on their business,
for the simple reason that they were able men, and had
some "book learning", and so, in that way, were better
educated than most of those who were not clerks. From
the clerks, too, were drawn the men whom we now call
lawyers. We have seen that there was a vast deal of
writing to be done in those days in connection with the
towns and the manors. Among these clerks were good
men and bad men: some who loved learning for its own
sake; some who found that it paid better than anything
else; and others who misused their privileges, did much
evil, and brought the name of "clerk" into sad disgrace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
Fairs</h2>

<p>The word "Fair" calls up to our minds all sorts of
wonderful sights and sounds&mdash;the stalls with their wonderful
"fairings" and "goodies"; the shows and the
shooting-galleries; the "flying horses", the "conjurors",
the performing dogs, and Punch and Judy; the wonderful
caravans and coco-nuts; the musical instruments of
all sorts, from the mouth-organ and "squeaker" to the
steam-organ of the roundabout.</p>

<p>Many such fairs are still held in every county and they
connect the present day very closely with the life of bygone
days. It is "all the fun of the fair" which draws
people to them mostly nowadays, but in some of them
there is still important business done; people are attracted
to them for trade as well as for pleasure.</p>

<p>Some of these fairs are held in big towns, such as
Lincoln and Carlisle. At Barnet a great horse fair is
held every year in September. But some big fairs are
held away from any large town, such as the big sheep
fair at Weyhill, in Hampshire. At Stourbridge, in
Cambridgeshire, a fair is still held; it is quite an ordinary
one now, but in the Middle Ages it was one of the
most important fairs, not only in England, but in Europe&mdash;a
great gathering, where East and West met to do
business with each other.</p>

<p>In some places the business part of the fair has quite
died out, and a few stalls, a roundabout, a shooting-gallery,
and swings are all that can be seen on a fair-day.</p>

<p>The word "fair" comes from an old word which means
a "feast" or festival. There are many villages which
still have their annual village feast, more important to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
village than Christmas or a "Bank Holiday". Houses
are turned out and cleaned from top to bottom; everything
must be made fit to be seen "for the feast". It is
a great meeting-time for families, and the boys and girls
who have gone away to work in some big town try to get
back for a few hours to their native village, to "the old
house at home".</p>

<div><a name="castle_and_butter_market_dunster_somersetshire" id="castle_and_butter_market_dunster_somersetshire"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>CASTLE AND BUTTER MARKET, DUNSTER, SOMERSETSHIRE</p>
<p>(See page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the beginning the village feast was connected with
the parish church&mdash;it was the festival of the saint after
whom the church was named. That day was a holiday,
and all the people went to church as a matter of course.
The church was the gathering-place, and, in the porch
and the churchyard, and on the village green, friends,
neighbours, and relatives met and had a time of rejoicing.</p>

<p>So many people coming together attracted pedlars and
hawkers, who spread out their goods on the green, in the
churchyard, and in the church porch itself. People who
met but seldom used the chance of doing a little business
with each other. Little by little, then, the "feast" became
a "fair", and in many cases was a very important
business and trading meeting.</p>

<p>Now it did not suit the ideas of people in those days
that outsiders should come into their village and buy and
sell as they chose. You know how the boys living in
one street even nowadays object to the boys from another
street coming to play in their street&mdash;"You go and play
in your own street". So in very early times the lord
of the manor began to regulate these things. Outsiders
who brought their goods for sale had to pay a "due"
or "toll" to the lord of the manor to be allowed to
trade; and the right of receiving tolls for fairs became
one of an overlord's privileges.</p>

<p>The people in the towns, who were more interested in
trade than the people in the villages, saw how very important
and profitable a fair was&mdash;that it was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
"with money in it"&mdash;and the towns were very anxious
to get the right to hold one or more annual fairs. But
the overlord, the king, had a voice in the matter, because
each stall set up, and each bale of goods, brought in "by
right" an income.</p>

<p>The king had the right to grant, almost to whom he
pleased, the privilege of holding a fair; and the privilege
was much sought after. Towns, as we saw in a former
chapter, got charters from the king, which very often
gave to them this right. But it was quite a common
thing for the king to make a grant of an annual fair to
a religious house which he wanted to benefit without
much cost to himself, and the profits of the fair went
to support the house. The king's nobles did the same
kind of thing in their own domains.</p>

<p>All the shops in the place where the fair was held had
to be shut while the fair was on, and nothing could be
bought or sold except in the fair. The tradesmen of
the place had to pay their tolls to the person or public
body to whom the fair had been granted, just as the
strangers coming into the town did.</p>

<p>Fairs lasted in some cases for only one day; in others
for two, three, or more days, and sometimes as long as
a fortnight, during which time, whether the inhabitants
liked it or not, all trade had to be carried on only in
the fair. That was one of the things which caused
jealousy between the trading class and the religious
houses, and often led to much ill-feeling and disorder.</p>

<p>Then, too, the king could grant to any person the
right to go to any fair in the country without paying
toll and duty. Of course those persons to whom the
king granted this right had to pay him very heavily for
this privilege, but you can see that it was quite worth
their while. Foreign merchants and Jews<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> often had
such privileges granted to them, and that partly accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
for the great dislike there was to these classes of
people.</p>

<p>Many of the religious houses had entered into trade
too, and very often the same privilege of putting their
goods on the market was granted to them. Members
of a religious house could often travel from place to
place without having to pay any of the tolls and duties
which other folk had to pay. That might be quite right
and reasonable when they were on some religious duty
or errand of mercy, but when it was connected with
buying and selling the goods produced or manufactured
on the monastery lands it was "rather hard", as we
should say, on the traders. The grievance grew up
gradually, but it caused very often a bitter feeling
between the towns and the religious houses in them,
which over and over again led to riots and bloodshed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />
Markets</h2>

<p>One of the pleasantest sights, to a Londoner at any
rate, is the market-place of an old-fashioned country
town on a market-day. In many such towns the weekly
market is held, in the open air, in the same place where
it has been held for centuries. Probably none of the
houses round the market-square is as old as the market,
but the buildings, altered and rebuilt as they have been,
take us back several centuries, and speak of days long
gone by.</p>

<p>A good many towns have built covered markets.
Some of them are near the old market-place, but in
other cases the market is now held in quite another part
of the town. Cattle-markets, which used to be held in
the open street in a busy thoroughfare, are now often
held in places more suitable for that purpose some distance
away from their old quarters.</p>

<p>Corn-markets are held in most market-towns, frequently
on the same day as the general market, and
many towns now boast a corn-exchange. Then, too,
in some places there are markets held in connection
with the chief trade of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The market-house is often a curious building. You
may almost speak of it as "a big room on legs". There
is a large room standing on stone or wooden arches.
The open space underneath serves to shelter some of
the market-stalls, and a staircase leads up from the street
to the room above, where the town council holds its
meetings. On the roof of this building is a turret containing
a clock, and perhaps a fire-bell and a market-bell.
There is such a quaint old market-house still
standing at Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, but so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
many of these old buildings have been pulled down to
make way for larger structures, in which the town can
carry on its business, and where the various officers
can have their offices, that the town hall is mostly now
a smart modern building.</p>

<p><i>Market Cross and Portion of Shelter, Winchester</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The stalls set up on the market-day are of the same
simple kind as those which have been used for centuries.
It is curious to notice how the different trades
keep to different parts of the market-place&mdash;butchers in
one place, greengrocers in another, and fishmongers in
another. Just as the trades had their special quarters
in the town, so they had in the market. Things have
altogether changed as far as the shops are concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
but the setting out of the market is almost exactly the
same to-day as it was five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The market cross still remains in some towns, but the
cross itself has in many cases disappeared long ago. In
some places the steps and the lower part of the cross
still remain, but there is a kind of open shed built round
it to form a shelter. Some of these shelters are very
ornamental, like those at Chichester and Winchester.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It is not an uncommon thing for such a cross as that to
be called the Butter Cross,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> from the fact that around
the cross was held the butter-market. Some of these
shelters are quaint rather than beautiful, and cover the
town pump, which is now carefully locked up. In some
places a drinking-fountain stands where once the cross
stood. At the cross a good deal of business was done.
The mayor or his officers would read out public notices
there on the market-day, that everybody might hear.
Not far from the cross was the cage, where folk who
had been "taken up" were set for a time. The stocks,
the pillory, and the whipping-post, in the seventeenth
century, were usually here in the market-place, not far
from the cross.</p>

<p>There is much to see in a market-place on a market-day.
If the market-day is Saturday, you will find the
place thronged with people, especially at night; and
even quite small towns are then so crowded that you
wonder where the people come from.</p>

<p>Fairs, in the Middle Ages, provided for much of the
wholesale trade of the country, and markets for the retail
trade. The two were very much alike, and the rights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to hold an annual fair and a weekly market mostly went
together.</p>

<div><a name="market_scene_in_the_middle_ages" id="market_scene_in_the_middle_ages"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Market Scene in the Middle Ages. The market cross is taken from an old
print of the market cross at Malmesbury</i></p>
<p>(<i>Note the Pillory, the Whipping-post, and the Stocks.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some places had, and still have, more than one market
a week. In many places the market has quite died out
now, but in the early days one of the first steps of a
"tun" towards becoming a "town" was to obtain the
right to hold a market. There are many of our modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
towns which have grown up in manufacturing districts,
near great railway centres, or near docks and railway
stations, which have no market. Nearly all of our old
towns have, or at one time <em>had</em>, the right of holding
markets.</p>

<p>Nobody can set up a stall in a market as he pleases.
On the market-day you will see the beadle going about
from stall to stall taking the toll from each stall-holder.
In many cases he wears an old-fashioned dress trimmed
with gold lace. He reminds us of the time when no
one except a freeman of the town could trade freely.
The stall-holders were "foreigners", and had to pay to
the town a toll for permission to sell in the town. In
our day you can go and settle in any town you please,
and open a shop just as you like, but you cannot so
easily take a stall and sell in the market: you must pay
the market toll even now. Such tolls go towards the
expenses of the town.</p>

<p>In the market the town and the country meet. In these
days, when the produce of the country can be quickly sent
into the heart of the largest town, the country provision-markets
are not of as much importance as they once
were, but they are very useful and very popular still.</p>

<p>There are many places where the market beadle rings
a hand-bell, or a bell in the clock-tower, to give notice
of the opening and closing of the market. In former
days, if a man dared to sell anything before the bell was
rung in the morning, or after it had rung in the evening,
he was very severely punished. Even now, goods may
not be sold in the market before or after the regular
market hours.</p>

<p>There were proper town officers appointed by the
mayor and corporation to look after the markets, and
to see that goods were sold at the proper market price,
and that there was no cheating in weight and measure,
and in the quality of the goods sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
Schools</h2>

<p>The earliest schools in England were held in the
monasteries, and were intended for boys and young
men who were to be trained as priests, missionaries,
or monks. There were famous schools at Canterbury,
York, and Jarrow in the seventh and eighth centuries.
In King Alfred's time, at the end of the ninth century,
great attention was paid to the teaching of both boys
and girls. Later still, in the tenth century, we find
the teaching of the young attracting great attention.</p>

<p>Latin was taught in these schools, and many of the
scholars became famous students and deep thinkers. In
the course of time others, besides those intending to
become monks and priests, were also taught, and became
clerks and found various employments, as we
have seen, in civil business.</p>

<p>Gradually other schools sprang up, outside the monasteries
and cathedrals, which were not meant for monks
or priests, though they were at first connected with
monasteries, colleges, and cathedrals. For instance, in
Norman times, not very long after the Conquest, there
were grammar-schools at Derby, St. Alban's, and Bury
St. Edmund's.</p>

<p>When we think of these schools we must not picture
to ourselves great buildings to hold two or three hundred
boys, such as we see now; nor must we suppose
that there was a great rush of pupils to them. Boys did
not go to school from nine till twelve, and from two till
four, with plenty of time for cricket, football, and sports
of all descriptions. School work was very hard, and
was regarded as a serious business. There was a great
deal of learning by heart to be done. You see, books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
were few and costly, and a man's best reference library
was his own well-stored memory. No doubt this hard
work helped to train the memory, and was good
discipline for the scholar.</p>

<p>In the monasteries and colleges, where boys were
trained to sing in the choir, they had to learn their
services by heart; for books were not provided for
them&mdash;a book was much too valuable in days when
they were all written by hand, and when printing first
came into use they were still far too costly for ordinary
monks and choir-boys to have one apiece, or even
enough for several to "look over". In the ordinary
services there were long psalms and passages of Scripture
attached to them which differed for every day, and
the boys had to know these perfectly in Latin. For
hours and hours every day the little fellows were drilled
in the services till they were word-perfect. There were
something like seven services to be learned for each of
the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year.</p>

<p>We talk of Latin nowadays as a dead language, but
it was anything but a dead language in the Middle
Ages. School was held all day long from quite early
in the morning; and during school-hours woe betide
the lads if they talked in any other language but
Latin.</p>

<p>Choir-boys had to be taught in the song-school as
well, how to sing their services, and the music was just
as difficult as the words and had also to be learned by
heart.</p>

<p>In the parish churches the priest and the parish clerk
had boys whom they trained to help in the services.
The services were much simpler and shorter than those
in the monasteries; but they were in Latin, and had to
be known by heart.</p>

<p>In the grammar and other schools the boys were
drilled in the works of old Latin scholars in much the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
same way, and in some cases in Greek authors as well,
with a certain amount of arithmetic and science.</p>

<div><a name="a_school_fourteenth_century" id="a_school_fourteenth_century"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>A School, Fourteenth Century</i></p>
<p><i>From an illuminated manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>There were no long weeks of holidays to look forward
to at Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, and in the
summer; but during the year there were many holy
days kept, which were holidays, on which neither schoolboys
nor villeins did their ordinary work. Thus, no
doubt, schoolboys managed to get a fair amount of
play, and found time for getting into mischief.</p>

<p>For instance, at St. Alban's we read that in the year
1310 the boys were forbidden to wander or run about
the streets and roads without reasonable cause. If a
lad did so, he was to be sought for and punished by
the master "in the accustomed way"; and every boy
knows what that was. Then, too, the scholars must
not bear arms, either in school or out of school. That
was to prevent them from fighting with the townspeople.
It is very curious to notice that even nowadays there is
often no love lost between "grammar boys" and "town
boys"; they can get up a quarrel almost as easily in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the twentieth century as they did in the thirteenth. It
shows itself whenever there happens to be a heavy fall
of snow, and sometimes tempers get "lost, or mislaid".</p>

<p>Boys took part in acting the earliest plays that were
represented in England. At first the plays dealt with
religious subjects, and were called "Mysteries" and
"Miracles"; and these plays and shows became very
popular in England. Geoffrey de Gorham, in early
Norman days, taught a school at Dunstable, and wrote
one of these plays called St. Catherine. He borrowed
vestments from St. Alban's Abbey, in which to dress
some of his characters; but on the following night his
house somehow caught fire, and his books and the borrowed
vestments were destroyed in the flames.</p>

<p>In the cloisters of some of our old cathedral churches
and colleges, such as Gloucester and Westminster, on
some of the old stone benches, there are holes and
scratches still to be seen where schoolboys of long ago
played games with marbles and stones.</p>

<p>By the thirteenth century there seem to have been
schools in all the chief towns. Though they may not
have held very many scholars, they were not intended
for the sons of well-to-do people only; they were for
poor scholars as well. Thus, at St. Alban's, provision
was made for sixteen poor scholars, and the same kind
of provision was quite common. There was some chance,
even in those days, for a lad with "brains" to get on in
the world. In fact, we know that in those Middle Ages
a good many men rose "from the ranks" to hold high
office in the state. There was, for instance, Thomas à
Becket. He was born in London, and not ashamed to
be known as Thomas of London. Then there was
Thomas Scot, who rose to be Archbishop of York and
Chancellor of England in the fifteenth century, who was
known as Thomas of Rotherham, after the place where
he was born. William of Wykeham, that great founder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
of schools, is still known by the name of the little out-of-the-way
Hampshire village where he was born&mdash;Wykeham.
Winchester College, the first of our public
schools, was founded by him. His real surname was
Longe, and the motto he chose&mdash;"Manners Makyth
Man"&mdash;is worth putting up in every school in the land.
We need to live up to that motto as much in these days
as ever.</p>

<p>But there were dunces in those days too, who made
little or no use of their opportunities, and others who
turned them to bad purposes, even as there are in this
twentieth century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
Universities</h2>

<p>Now, just as the tide flows and ebbs, so in England
did interest in learning rise and fall during the Middle
Ages. Schools of all kinds had their good times and
their bad times. Sometimes we find the thirst for
learning being shown in one direction; then it almost
died away for a time, revived again, and took another
direction.</p>

<p>At first we see it going in the direction of making
monks and priests and missionaries; then in that of
making able men who could take part in the civil business
of the manor, the town, and the country; and then,
in the thirteenth century, it began again to take a turn
towards learning for learning's sake.</p>

<p>As we get near to the thirteenth century, we find the
beginnings of our English universities. A university
was a corporation or body of learned men who bound
themselves together to teach, and who got the sole right
of appointing teachers in their districts. A man
could only have leave to teach after his knowledge and
ability had been well tried by them; and when that leave
was given he was said to take his degree.</p>

<p>The opportunity of getting wider knowledge and
higher teaching attracted scholars, lads and young men
who had had their early teaching in the small colleges
and grammar-schools. They were encouraged and in
many ways helped to go to the university. Gifts were
left to their old schools to help the likely boys to go to
the university; many of the monasteries and colleges
sent their pupils there, and it was looked upon as a pious
work and a work of mercy to help poor scholars in this
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Scholars flocked in hundreds to various universities,
and we find Oxford and Cambridge rising as university
towns. We cannot say exactly when this began, but we
read that in King John's reign, in the year 1209, there
was a great "town and gown" riot at Oxford. Three
of the gownsmen were hanged as a punishment; so
about three thousand of the rest left Oxford and went to
other universities, and Oxford was deserted for a time.
These facts show that by the beginning of the thirteenth
century, just when the Early English style of architecture
was coming into fashion, universities, with their
"higher education", were very important institutions.</p>

<div><a name="gloucester_hall_now_worcester_college_oxford_founded_1283" id="gloucester_hall_now_worcester_college_oxford_founded_1283"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Gloucester Hall, now Worcester College, Oxford, founded 1283</i></p>
<p><i>From a drawing made in 1673, when a considerable portion of the thirteenth-century
building still remained little altered.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>At first it seems that the scholars at the university
lived in the town, where they chose or where they could,
attending the various lecture-halls. Then various
people seem to have hit upon the plan of setting up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
houses in the town, and letting the rooms to the
scholars, so that a number of them might live together.
Thus they were divided up into different sets. These
houses were called hostels, and we find them at Cambridge
in the beginning of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Early, too, in this same century a new religious order
found its way to England&mdash;the Friars. The Dominican
Friars were a very learned teaching order, and when
they settled at Oxford they greatly strengthened the
work of the university and kept it alive and active.</p>

<p>A Surrey man, Walter de Merton, Chancellor and
Bishop of Rochester, was the inventor or founder of
colleges at the universities such as we know them to-day.
In the hostels the scholars did pretty much as they
pleased, chose their own officers, and made their own
rules. There was much disorder after a while; many
quarrels and fights took place between one hostel and
another, as well as with the townsfolk. Merton spent
twelve years in thinking out his plan, and at last, in the
year 1264, he founded or established the first of the
Oxford Colleges.</p>

<p>The old monasteries and colleges in the early times
had been founded to keep up a continual round of
worship, work, and learning; the special work of these
new colleges was to promote learning and fellowship.
In many ways they were like the older convents; but
the work of education was the chief object of these new
foundations, and we find teachers and taught, governors
and pupils, living under the same roof, under rule and
order.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>Merton's idea was soon afterwards followed at Cambridge,
where Peterhouse was opened in the year 1284.
During this century, too, we find a rival university
springing up at Stamford; in fact in the year 1333 a
number of masters and scholars left Oxford for Stamford;
but, owing to the opposition of Oxford and Cambridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
it was gradually snuffed out, though there are
still standing some interesting buildings which were connected
with it. College after college, at both Oxford
and Cambridge, has been founded since then; each
one has its own special laws and government, which
have been altered from time to time. For many centuries
now Oxford and Cambridge have been cities of
colleges, and these "ancient seats of learning" are
quite unlike any other places in the country.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Many old customs are kept up still at Oxford and
Cambridge; the scholars and officials of the colleges and
universities go about in their gowns, as they have done
for centuries, and each university has still rights and
privileges in the government of the town which have
naturally come to it in the course of time. The town
and the townsfolk have their special
interests and government; so that there
are two authorities, side by side, responsible
for law and order. The gown
and the town depend upon each other;
and in days gone by they have, times
without number, misunderstood each
other, and quarrelled, and fought.</p>

<p>In the reign of King Edward III
Oxford was the most famous seat of
learning in Europe. Many of its
students were foreigners, but, as everyone
could talk Latin as well as he
could his native language, they had
no real difficulty in making themselves
understood.</p>

<p>Within the last hundred years, in
order to meet modern requirements, universities
have been founded at Durham,
London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester,
Leeds, Sheffield, and Bristol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br />
Changes Brought About by the<br />
Black Death</h2>

<p>In the middle of the fourteenth century, in the reign
of King Edward III, came the Black Death. It carried
off half the population of the country at least, and all
classes of society felt its effects.</p>

<p>We have said that in some of the old parish churches
you can see, by some of the work done just after this
time, that the builders were very much poorer than
they had been, and had to finish off in a very plain
fashion work begun on a grand scale. You must remember,
too, that there were several different kinds of
landowners or overlords&mdash;the king, the great lords,
bishops, colleges, and monasteries. The manors, of
which these estates were made up, in the course of
centuries were divided and subdivided in many ways
as the land became more valuable. Many people
might thus have an interest in one manor which a
couple of hundred years before had been in the hands
of one person only. That made law business very
complicated when these little parcels of land changed
hands.</p>

<p>Though manors could not be bought and sold outright,
little by little money was paid to have bits of
manors and the various rights in manors let out, or
leased, for a term of years. This was especially the
case with property in towns, and with lands belonging
to corporations, like colleges and monasteries, which
were often scattered about in various parts of the
country.</p>

<p>On the manors in the country districts the same thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
was going on, though perhaps more slowly than in the
towns. It became much more convenient for the villeins
and cottiers, and other tenants of a manor, to pay a rent
to the lord instead of actually working on the lord's
land. At first this rent was paid in the produce of the
land&mdash;a few hens or eggs, a calf or a lamb, or so much
corn, till by and by we find actual payments in money
as rent.</p>

<p>Then, too, a class of labourers had gradually sprung
up on the manors. As the tenants and villeins began
to pay to the lord a quit-rent, instead of working so
many days a week on the land, the lord of the manor
had to employ persons to do the work on his home-farm.
These would naturally be the cottiers and serfs
on the manor&mdash;the "landless men"&mdash;who thus became
what we know as labourers.</p>

<p>All these had to be accounted for in the manor court,
which was held regularly every few weeks. If a labourer
was missing he was sought for, and brought back to
the manor, which he might not leave without his lord's
permission. It is quite true that if he could only remain
unclaimed in some borough town for a year and a day
he was no longer bound to the lord of his native manor;
but the towns did not encourage strangers, as we have
seen. If, however, labour happened to be wanted in
the town, no doubt his being there would be "winked
at" and no notice would be taken of his "harbouring"
there; and in this way numbers managed to get their
freedom.</p>

<p>But it was not an easy matter for a labourer to get
away from his native manor. After the Black Death,
labour became very scarce, for on some of the manors
almost every tenant and labourer died. All over the
country land-workers were wanted badly; and tenants
and landlords, when they were so hard pushed, were
glad to employ almost any man who appeared, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
did not trouble to ask whose "man he was" or whence
he came.</p>

<p>The wages of the labourers, of course, went up; but
before very long the landlords saw that that would not
do; it made their farming so much more expensive, and
so their incomes tended to grow less and less. Law
after law was passed to get the labourers back to
their native manors, and to keep down the price of
labour.</p>

<div><a name="labourers_felling_a_tree_fourteenth_century" id="labourers_felling_a_tree_fourteenth_century"></a></div>

<i>manuscript in the British Museum</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>All classes of overlords, and especially the colleges
and monasteries, had much difficulty in working their
lands, and so the custom of letting them out in farms
increased a good deal after the Black Death.</p>

<p>At first the owners let out these farms with a certain
amount of stock on them. They were let for so many
years, or for so many lives. At the end of the time the
farm had to be given up and the stock replaced as it had
been at the first. The land belonging to the farm was
mixed up with the land of other tenants in the manor,
in the big unenclosed fields, and had to be farmed still
according to the old customs of the manor. Some of
the very oldest
farms existing to
this day began in
this kind of way,
and there are
possibly a few
of the very oldest
farm-houses which
were first built
early in the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />
Wool</h2>

<p>The two great industries of England in the Middle
Ages were agriculture and wool-raising. The wool
was the finest grown in Europe, and attracted hither
merchants from the Continent. They travelled through
England&mdash;in the Cotswold and Hampshire districts,
for instance&mdash;and bought wool largely. But in pretty
early days England began to manufacture cloth of
various kinds; and that, too, became an important
article of export. This manufacture was especially
strong in the eastern and western parts of the country.</p>

<p>Weavers from Flanders were encouraged to settle
in various parts of England, by several of the Norman
kings, soon after the Conquest. This was the case
in Gloucestershire, for example; but the manufacture
declined in the reigns of King John and King Henry
III. In the reign of King Edward III it was again
introduced.</p>

<p>As the country began to recover from the effects of
the Black Death, the cloth trade became a very flourishing
industry, and English wool-merchants became
a very wealthy and powerful body. These have left
their mark on the churches of the land pretty plainly.
At the end of the fourteenth century, and in the fifteenth,
some of the finest Decorated and Perpendicular work
was done, and a large number of churches, especially
in Suffolk, Gloucestershire, and Somersetshire, have
magnificent towers, which were built at this period.
It is pretty safe to say that where to-day you find
a little village with a big church&mdash;very much larger
than the place now needs&mdash;with a good deal of work
belonging to the Decorated and early Perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
periods, that those places were once engaged in some
branch or other of the wool and cloth trades.</p>

<p>Many of the fine brasses of which we spoke in a
former chapter cover the graves of merchants "of the
staple", as these great wool and cloth traders were
called. Then, too, some of the very finest timbered
houses, with their richly carved fronts, as in Chester
and Shrewsbury, were built at this same time.</p>

<p>We have spoken before of the trade guilds. These,
too, after the Black Death period, increased in power
and wealth. Each guild looked well after the interests
of its own craft. It regulated the number of apprentices
which a craftsman might have, the hours of work,
the rate of pay; it made provision for helping its
members in sickness and need; and it saw to burying
them decently when they died. Guilds took a lively
interest in their parish churches, helped sometimes in
forming new schools, hospitals, and alms-houses, and
had regular times for meeting together for business
and for feasting. They were good to their members,
but very hard on those who were not of their number.</p>

<p>From the members of these trade guilds in a town
the town guild, or corporation, was formed to rule
the town according to its ancient customs and charters,
and to obtain for the town as many new rights and
privileges as possible. There is much in the corporation
of a great city like London, with its many companies,
or guilds,
which is connected
with city life and
work of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />
The Poor</h2>

<p>From early Christian times in England to relieve the
poor was looked upon as a Christian duty, and every
church and religious house took its part in the work
as a matter of course. You will remember that in
early days there was not much moving about of people
from one manor to another, so that it was not at first
difficult to know the sick and the needy in each place,
whether in town or country. Many religious houses
or hospitals were founded for the purposes of relief.
They were not on a large scale, but there were a good
many of them. In the fourteenth century pilgrimages
were very popular, and many pilgrims were always
to be found on the road.</p>

<p>We must remember that there was another side to
a pilgrimage besides the religious one. A pilgrimage
was one way of travelling and seeing the world. Indeed
it was almost the only means by which a poor man
could travel and have change of scene. Permission was
given for that purpose because it was regarded as a
religious act. It is not at all surprising that folk who
wanted to see the world often took advantage of a pilgrimage
from no very religious motive. Pilgrims could
always find food and lodging at a religious house on
their way, and there were scores of places in England to
which pilgrimages might be made, to say nothing of a
journey to the Holy Land, or to the shrine of St. James
of Compostello, which were two grand pilgrimages.</p>

<p>In time pilgrimages became somewhat of a nuisance,
for many of the people taking part in them were anything
but pious; and, towards the end of the fourteenth
century, strict measures were taken to prevent beggars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and servants from wandering from one hundred to
another on pretence of going on a pilgrimage. Each
had to have a letter, properly signed by an officer of
the hundred, giving him leave.</p>

<p>But beggars and wanderers increased. We find some
towns, in Tudor times, taking steps to put down beggars.
In the early part of the sixteenth century vagabonds
found in London were to be "tayled<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> at a cart's tayle",
and collections were made for the poor weekly, and
distributed at the church door. In the year 1536 there
were fifteen hospitals and four lazar-houses in the city of
London. At the dissolution of the religious houses all
these were seized, but the city managed to save St.
Mary Spital, St. Thomas's Hospital, and St. Bartholomew's
Hospital. The city found that it could
not get enough money to keep even one of these going,
so a tax was levied for the purpose. Bishop Ridley
and others tried to draw up a scheme for finding work
for the poor, teaching them to make caps, feather-bed
ticks, nails, and ironwork.</p>

<p>Other towns tried the same plan, and the king and
Parliament issued many orders about the treatment of
the poor and vagabonds. But it was much easier to
issue these orders than to carry them out, and the
beggars increased in numbers and in impudence in
spite of all. In 1547 it was ordained that a sturdy
beggar might be made a slave for two years, and, if he
ran away, then he was to remain a slave for life. The
sons of vagabonds were to be apprenticed till they were
twenty-four years old, and their daughters till they were
twenty years of age, and, if they rebelled, they were sent
to slavery. The idea was to train them to work.</p>

<p>In all this the difficulty was, how to find the money
to carry out these schemes. The king had swept away
all the goods and gifts which had been made to monasteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
churches, and hospitals; the free-will offerings of
many generations had gone into the pockets of the king;
the institutions which had been founded to help the poor
had become the private property of the king's favourites.
It was not likely that people would be very keen to offer
their money for the relief of the poor, and though urged
to give what they could, they were very backward in
doing so. Later on, in Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
dwellers in each parish were urged to find work for the
labourers in their parish; but the beggars still wandered
and the poor still abounded.</p>

<p>In the year 1572 some very severe laws were made
concerning vagabonds. A man who was convicted a
third time of being a vagabond was to be punished with
death. Habitations were to be found for all the poor
belonging to a parish; no strangers were to be allowed
to settle in a parish; and each parish was to be taxed
for the relief of the poor. At the same time, every
parish was to find something to do for all the poor who
were able to work. Usually a stock of wool, hemp, and
flax was bought, and the poor were supposed to be
taught to spin. Each county was also to provide a
House of Correction, where those who would not work
should be forced to do so.</p>

<p>To keep down the number of poor people in a parish,
order was given that only one family might live in one
house, and no new house might be built in the country
unless it had four acres of ground attached to it. In the
cities of London and Westminster, and for three miles
round them, no houses were to be built except for persons
worth a specified amount. Houses might not be
divided into tenements, nor might lodgers be taken in.</p>

<p>All this was to keep people as much as possible in the
places where they belonged. The churchwardens and
overseers had to attend to the relief of the poor. There
are, belonging to a good many parishes in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
old account-books, showing how these officers raised
and spent money on the relief of the poor. Some of
these books go right back to this time, though most of
them begin a good deal later. These officers had to
keep a very sharp look-out. Of course they did not
want the poor-rate to be any higher than they could
help, so strangers coming into the parish were quickly
tracked and hindered from gaining a settlement there.
Vagabonds and strolling players were hurried out of the
parish, and in some cases whipped. The stocks, the
whipping-post, and the cage were set up near the churchyard
gate, and they were in pretty constant use.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Wayfarers, Early Fourteenth Century. From a
manuscript in the British Museum.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The officers were very anxious, too, to prevent any
travellers from falling ill in their parish. Those who
were sick, and could possibly be moved, they shifted on
to the next parish, lest they should become chargeable
to the parish. Some parishes spent a good deal of
money, and the officers much time, in conveying people
out of their bounds. That led, we may imagine, to
many disputes between
parishes, and gave the
court of Quarter Sessions
a lot of work to do;
for amongst the many
things which Quarter
Sessions had to attend
to was the carrying out
of the Poor Laws.</p>

<p>Parishes had to look
after and to support
their own poor in much
the same way right
down to the early part
of the nineteenth century,
less than a hundred
years ago.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />
Changes in Houses and<br />
House-building</h2>

<p>In the time of King Edward III, that is, in the fourteenth
century, there was a great change in the arrangement
of castles and castle-building. We cannot say
much about it here, it would take too long; but the
changes made show that there was a desire to make
the castle not merely a strong defence against an
enemy, but also a dwelling-place for the baron, his
family, his servants, and men-at-arms. Many buildings
were added for comfort and convenience. In fact, a
castle became a kind of little town.</p>

<p>William of Wykeham, that great master-builder, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
not only a builder of churches and colleges, but a castle-builder
as well. The great Round Tower at Windsor
Castle, and other parts of that building still in use, are
his work; but in later times it has been much restored.
The general arrangement of the Tower of London will
give us an idea of the sort of habitation a castle of the
fourteenth century was intended to be. In fact, we may
say that every old castle, which is still inhabited, has
considerable indications of work done in this and the
following centuries, to fit it to be a comfortable dwelling-place
as well as a fortress.</p>

<p>A good many houses, too, were protected by walls,
and sometimes even called "castles", though they were
not what we usually understand by the term. Many of
these were moated houses, the moat forming the first
line of protection. Then came the battlemented wall,
within which the house proper was built.</p>

<p>The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were stirring
war times, and the nobles kept up bands of armed men,
who lived close to, and even in, their strong houses and
castles. In the fifteenth century, during the long period
of the Wars of the Roses, there was much work for these
"men-at-arms to do". This constant warfare weakened
at length the power of the barons. Sometimes the
Yorkist king, sometimes the Lancastrian king, was in
power; and whichever side got the upper hand the king
seized the property of the nobles on the other side.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the nobles killed each other off,
and when Henry Tudor, a Lancastrian, became king,
there was an enormous amount of power in his hands;
and he used it so as to keep a closer grip of it.</p>

<p>The towns and the traders had no liking for war, and
they were quite satisfied to see the government of the
country in the hands of a strong king. The new nobles,
whom King Henry VII made, had most of them sprung
from the merchant and trading class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
These new men, and even the king's own friends and
supporters, were not allowed to keep bands of armed
servants or retainers, able to turn the scale of a battle
against the king. The Earl of Warwick, the "Kingmaker",
had played that game several times; and it was
through Lord Stanley bringing his men over from
King Richard III's side to the side of Henry in this
way that he had won the Battle of Bosworth, and
placed the English crown on Henry's head.</p>

<p>After becoming king, Henry VII determined that these
bands of armed men, who would follow the whistle of
their lord, must be put down. He therefore set to work
cautiously, but he had his way. The nobles might no
longer keep hosts of servants in livery as they pleased.
The king cut down the numbers, so that he might be in
a position to say to any of his nobles that his good word
he did not want, and his bad word he cared nothing at
all about.</p>

<p>You will remember the story of King Henry VII and
the Earl of Oxford. The king went to pay the earl a
visit, and his host, to show him honour, had two long
lines of stout retainers, all armed and dressed in his
livery, drawn up to meet him. He did all in his power
to show honour to the king. When the visit was over,
the king said to the earl:</p>

<p>"I thank you, my lord, for your good cheer, but I
may not endure to have my laws broken in my sight;
my attorney must speak with you."</p>

<p>Then there was "trouble"; and the earl thought himself
very fortunate in getting out of the "scrape" by
paying a small fine of ten thousand pounds. It was
very awkward for a man to be a noble in Tudor times.
He never knew exactly where he was. The king might
be making a great fuss with him one day, clapping him
in the Tower a few days after, and then chopping off his
head and ornamenting London Bridge with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Well, this did away with the necessity for big fortified
houses which might contain barracks for soldiers, and
so we find that the new houses, built in Tudor times,
were less like fortresses than they had been before.
More attention was now paid to the size and convenience
of the rooms. This sixteenth century was a great time
for the building of large houses; indeed, the new nobles
had better ideas of what a comfortable house was than
the older barons had.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />
The Ruins of the Monasteries and<br />
the New Buildings</h2>

<p>In early Tudor times our towns were much more
picturesque than they are to-day. That was chiefly
owing to the fact that there were in every town so many
religious houses, colleges, and hospitals. These buildings
all had grounds of their own in the town, some
more, some less; but these open spaces and garden
grounds, though they were not open to the public, all
helped to make the town airy, and to give variety to the
view.</p>

<p>The buildings themselves were all different, and many
of them were hundreds of years old. Towers, spires,
turrets, gables, gateways, and archways in all styles of
architecture abounded. There were, of course, many
things in the towns which we should not have liked, but
they had a pleasant variety and picturesque appearance
which our modern towns have not. Thousands of streets
in our towns are just rows and rows of houses&mdash;brick
boxes with slate lids&mdash;all alike, all ugly, and very dull
and dreary to look at and to live in.</p>

<p>In the reign of King Henry VIII all the religious
houses were suppressed, and given up into the king's
hands. The life that had gone on in them for centuries
came to an end. Both in town and country districts
there were many people besides those who actually lived
in them to whom this made a great difference&mdash;people
who, in one way or another, got their living out of the
monasteries. Shutting up the monasteries threw all
these people, so to speak, out of work, and created what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
we call a "very difficult problem". That meant a great
deal of suffering.</p>

<p>Nowadays, if a factory which has employed a number
of people is suddenly closed, it means suffering for those
who have been employed there and for their families.
Now, though the monasteries did not employ people in
the way in which a factory does, it did affect in many
ways those who lived and worked and depended on
them.</p>

<p>In these days, if people are thrown out of employment
in one place they are free to go and seek it in another;
but that was not the case in the reign of Henry VIII.
If they wandered from their native towns and villages
they were treated as vagabonds. It is true that the new
persons, to whom the monastery lands were granted,
were supposed to do for the people on the land&mdash;the
poor and the sick&mdash;what the monasteries had done for
them. But what they were <em>supposed</em> to do and what they
<em>did do</em> were very different things.</p>

<div><a name="wollaton_hall_nottinghamshire" id="wollaton_hall_nottinghamshire"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<p>[See page <a href="#Page_142">142</a>]</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is pretty easy to see how things worked. A wealthy
man managed to get a grant of the property of several
monasteries at a very cheap rate. He did not want these
places to live in; he wanted to make money out of them.
The first thing that he did was to strip the buildings of
everything which would fetch any money. The lead
was usually the most valuable part of what the king had
left. The roofs would be stripped, the graves broken
open to get at the leaden coffins, and the windows
smashed for the sake of the lead. Then the building
was left standing a ruin. The poor people of the district
had been used to receive food daily at the monastery
gate, and no doubt had grumbled at the quality and
quantity of the food often enough. But now it was no
use going to the monastery gate, for the place was a
ruin. They could not go to the new lord's house, for
that might be miles away. Even if they did find him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
he might be the owner of three or four such ruined
monasteries. How could he be quite sure that they
were the poor he was bound to relieve? And so the
poor folk lost the daily food on which they had depended.</p>

<p>Then as regards the land. The new landlord, perhaps,
might farm his fields; in which case the rents,
instead of going to the monastery, went into his pocket.
But he was not always on the spot, and very frequently
the land was let out to tenants; an agent or steward
collected the rents, and the tenants never saw their landlord.
But many of these new owners found that the
management of the estates caused them a lot of trouble;
and, naturally enough, from their point of view, they
wanted to get as much money out of the property as
they could at the least cost to themselves.</p>

<p>Now there was in this sixteenth century still a great
demand for wool, and many of these landlords found it
would save trouble to turn these monastery lands into
sheep-runs. A very few men could look after a great
many sheep, and there would be no bother about keeping
up buildings and barns. If the people were got
off the land, there would be no poor to bother about
relieving. So it came to pass that much land, which
had been cultivated for many centuries, went out of
cultivation, and the people were turned adrift. It was
a hard state of affairs. The rights which they had had
to relief from the religious houses were taken from them,
and the means of getting their living also taken away;
they were robbed of their employment, and punished
for wandering, for not working, and for begging.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many instances in which the
new landlord came and lived near the old monastery.
In some cases the old buildings were altered and turned
into a dwelling-house; in others the building material
was used for building a brand-new house close by.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
When this was the case the old custom of relieving the
poor who came to the gate did not quickly die out.</p>

</div></div>

<p>For instance, at Standon in Hertfordshire, there was
a house belonging to the Knights Hospitallers. When
the house was dissolved, much of the property at Standon
went to Sir Ralph Sadleir, who had been secretary
to Thomas Cromwell, the "hammer of the monks".
He owned Standon Lordship, and when the poor were
no longer relieved at the Hospitallers' House in the
village, they trooped from Standon up to Standon Lordship,
about fifty of them, every day. That custom of
relieving the poor was kept up there for many years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL<br />
The New Houses of the Time of<br />
Queen Elizabeth</h2>

<p>There were, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, in all
parts of the country, hundreds of bare, gaunt ruins where
once had been flourishing houses and centres of life and
work. It may seem strange to us that the materials left
were not sold and cleared away, and the sites made tidy.
We must remember, however, that people could not
build houses either in town or country as they chose.
In Queen Elizabeth's reign the laws against building new
houses were very strict indeed, so that there was not a
very great demand for building material. Then, too, the
quantity of such stone and wood in all these many buildings,
in every town and almost every village, was enormous,
so that the material was not worth much. The ruins
were left, a sad and sorry sight, for many a long year.</p>

<p>In the towns some of the buildings were turned by their
new owners into private houses, and the parts of the
monastery were put to strange uses. Nobody seemed to
mind; the spirit of destruction seemed to be in the air.
Then, as years went on, and buildings needed repair, or
roads wanted mending, the old ruins were the handiest
places from which to get a load of stone; and so, with
leave or without, many loads of stone were carted away
from them.</p>

<p>We said just now that there was no encouragement
given to the building of new houses in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, and yet most of the most picturesque old
houses in our towns and villages still standing were built
at that time. These, however, were not new houses;
they were rebuilt on old sites, <em>improved</em> according to the
ideas of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<div><a name="moreton_old_hall_cheshire_built_1550_59" id="moreton_old_hall_cheshire_built_1550_59"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Moreton Old Hall, Cheshire, built 1550-59. An example of the half-timbered,
Elizabethan house for which Cheshire and Shropshire are specially famous</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>You will notice in country places a great many houses
built somewhat after this style. Many of them are now
cottages, but they were not built for cottages; they were
the ordinary houses in which yeomen lived in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>There was the hall or house-place&mdash;an oblong room in
the centre&mdash;on to which other rooms were built, forming
a wing at one end, or often a wing at each end, with
gables towards the street, and projecting upper stories.
A great deal might be said about this kind of house, but
there is only space for a very short account of it.</p>

<p>The house was built upon a foundation of stone or
brick, so that the wooden sill should be above the
ground-level. Into this wooden sill strong upright
posts of timber, quite rough, some eight or nine inches
square, were set. The posts at the angles were larger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
often being butts of trees placed roots upwards, so that
the upper story might project. Then on the main posts
beams were laid, the ends projecting, upon which the
framing of the upper story was set. It was just a timber
skeleton, into which other timbers were set eight or nine
inches apart. In later times these timbers were wider
apart, and curved or diagonal braces were often used,
but at first the uprights were pretty closely set.</p>

<p>The spaces between the uprights were then filled in
with lath and plaster, flush with the woodwork. In
some parts of the country brick was used instead, set in
herring-bone fashion. In later times, when the lath and
plaster had decayed, the spaces were often filled in with
brickwork laid in the ordinary way. Then again, in other
cases the woodwork of the house shrank and left gaps
between the lath and plaster and the wood, so the whole
of the outside has been covered with plaster, or weatherboarded
and painted or tarred, or hung over with tiles.</p>

<p>The windows were small, and sometimes in the upper
story one was built out, forming an oriel. The roofs
were high pitched, in many cases tiled, but more often
thatched. In these old houses the chimney-stack is a
great feature outside, and the huge fireplace, with its
wide chimney-corners, takes up half the house-place
inside. From most of these nowadays the old hearth is
gone, and a small chimney-breast has been bricked up
to take a modern range; but the old chimney-corner,
with its funny little window, can usually still be traced.</p>

<p>There are quite a large number of village inns of this
kind. Very often these are the oldest and most picturesque
buildings left in a village, except the church. It
is these old-fashioned houses which make village scenery
so pleasing to the eye after the dreary rows of bunches
of brick, with holes in them for windows, covered in with
slate, which fill the streets of our towns, all alike, and all
ugly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI<br />
Larger Elizabethan and Jacobean<br />
Houses</h2>

<p>We have said that the Tudor period was a time of
building of big houses and mansions. Every county in
England has some such houses to show. Many of them
were built of stone, some partly of brick and stone.
Their style shows that the English or old fashion of
Gothic building was dying out. Italian ideas and Italian
ornament were coming into favour. No doubt one
reason why so much of the old work was ruthlessly
destroyed was because it was out of fashion. It is
astonishing, even in these days, how much good work
is destroyed just because it has gone out of date. Among
the most famous of these houses we may mention Burleigh
House "by Stamford Town", Haddon Hall, and
Knebworth; and, belonging to a rather later date, Hatfield
House.</p>

<p>For a big house the idea was to build it round a
quadrangle. Smaller houses were in plan very like
the half-timbered houses of the yeomen, only on a
larger scale, and more richly ornamented. The hall
and its wings were extended considerably, and, with
a handsome porch, formed in plan a big capital E,
thus:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Some people have thought that this plan was chosen in
honour of Queen Elizabeth, but the truth is that it was
the most convenient form, and fitted in best with the
ideas of the time. It had grown up quite naturally, in
the course of many generations, from the simple hall
with the hearth in the middle, the beginnings of which
we saw in the huts of the pit-dwellers.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Quite early in the fourteenth century brick had begun
to come into use for building, but the first bricks were
probably imported from Flanders. Hull, which had
been founded by King Edward I, had many buildings
of brick, and by about the year 1320 it had brick-yards
of its own. Flemish weavers were encouraged to settle
in England by King Edward III, and they used brick
in buildings which they set up. There are a good

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
many houses in the eastern counties and in Kent still
standing, which show Flemish and Dutch ideas.</p>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey's palace at Hampton Court is a
good specimen of the brickwork of his time; and all
through the reign of King Henry VIII the chief
material used was brick, terra-cotta<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> being employed
for mouldings and ornament. This was chiefly the
work of Italian artists, and they produced also some
very beautiful ceilings in plaster-work<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> for many of
their fine houses.</p>

<p>After King Henry VIII's quarrel with Rome fewer
Italians were employed, and English artists were left to
work out these new ideas in their own way. From
about the middle of the sixteenth century the use of
terra-cotta dropped out, and moulded and shaped bricks
began to be used, though stone was used for the more
ornamental portions.</p>

<p>When we reach the reign of King James I, we find
that the leading architect was Inigo Jones. We do not
hear very much of architects during the Middle Ages.
The man employed to do the actual work was allowed to
select his own materials and carry out his own ideas
pretty much in his own way. But in the sixteenth
century the architect became a more important person
than the craftsman, and the craftsman had to work
according to the pattern and design provided for him.</p>

<p>The Jacobean<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> houses show that the old English
styles of building were being left behind, and a newer
type of house, plainer and heavier, was taking its place.
The Civil War was a very bad time for architects and
craftsmen, but after the Restoration a better time came
to them again.</p>

<p>The Great Fire of London, which swept away almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
every mediæval building in the city, gave a great
<em>impetus</em>, or push forward, to building. You can quite
understand that, with so much building going on, the
work would be somewhat hurried and very much
plainer than it had been. So London became a city
of bricks and mortar. Middlesex has large quantities
of good brick-earth; and though bricks were made in
that county long before the Great Fire, the Great Fire
developed the industry greatly. There was a worthy
old Royalist knight of Hammersmith, Sir Nicholas
Crispe, who, after the execution of King Charles I, went
over to Holland, as so many other Royalists did. There
he watched very closely bricks and brick-making, and
when he came back to England he introduced many
improvements in the art of brick-making along the
Thames valley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII<br />
Churches after the Reformation</h2>

<p>Not very long after the dissolution of the monasteries
the churches had a very bad time to go through. It is
perfectly marvellous how rapidly some people, who were
in power, discovered that the valuable ornaments and
fittings in them were so very wicked and superstitious,
that the only thing to do was to seize them for the use
of the king as his private property. No attempt was
made to apply the money taken for the benefit of the
parishes; it was shamefully and shamelessly squandered.
The buildings were very badly treated, and
everything in some of them that could be defaced and
destroyed was so treated. The changes made in religion
under the Tudor kings and queens were so many, and so
violent, that ordinary everyday people could not understand
them, and deeply religious people were driven in
opposite directions. There was bitter persecution for
all who did not fall in with the will of the Tudor
sovereign, whether Catholic or Protestant, and good
men had to suffer and to die on both sides for their
faith.</p>

<p>All who did not attend their parish church, and take
part in the services which those in authority considered
to be most fitting, were regarded as bad citizens, and
treated as such. We cannot wonder that the parish
churches were allowed to go to decay. English people
had spent much money on their churches right up to the
time of the Reformation. Then they saw the gifts they
and their forefathers had made abused or stolen. People
were not disposed to do much for their churches after
that. In some cases, especially in country places
where the leading people were Catholics or Puritans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
it seems as if they purposely let the parish church, to
which they were compelled to go by law, get so
thoroughly out of order that they might be able to say
there was no church to go to.</p>

<div><a name="monument_in_chelsea_church_london_date_about_1630" id="monument_in_chelsea_church_london_date_about_1630"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>Many of the houses built during Tudor times had
secret chambers and hiding-places, which were known
only to a very few persons. And such hiding-places
were much used, in the times of Queen Elizabeth and
King James I, by priests, who ministered in secret to
those who clung to the old faith.</p>

<p>But though the churches were much out of repair, in
some of them stately and costly monuments were erected
in the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth centuries.
They were different from the monuments set up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
before the Reformation, and were usually built against a
wall. They were of various coloured marbles, the
effigies lying under circular-headed canopies, supported
by columns in the Italian style. The effigies of man
and wife were usually represented clad in robes of state,
coloured, their children kneeling round the tomb in
various attitudes.</p>

<p>By and by, instead of the effigies being represented
as lying on their backs, with hands clasped, they were
shown lying on one side, supporting their heads on their
hands. There are many such monuments, for instance,
in Westminster Abbey, and in almost every old town
church one or more can be seen.</p>

<p>It became a very common practice for one of the old
chapels, built on to the parish church in mediæval times,
to be set apart as the private burial-place of a great
landowner. Many new chapels were built for this
special purpose. In them we may see specimens of the
different fashions in monuments from Tudor days, or
earlier, right down to the present time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII<br />
Building after the Restoration: Houses</h2>

<p>The most notable architect after the Great Fire of
London was Sir Christopher Wren, and his masterpiece
is, of course, St. Paul's Cathedral. He designed,
too, most of the city churches. The style was adopted
in various parts of the country by various noblemen for
building great houses. Brick was regarded as too mean
a material for such very grand houses, and stone was
used for facing them.</p>

<p>In the houses which Wren built brick was very largely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
used. He introduced rubbed bricks, and had them laid
with very close joints. We have some very fine examples
of such brickwork in gables of various forms in the early
part of the eighteenth century&mdash;the reign of Queen Anne.</p>

<div><a name="house_at_rainham_essex_built_during_the_reign_of_queen_anne" id="house_at_rainham_essex_built_during_the_reign_of_queen_anne"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>House at Rainham, Essex, built during the reign of Queen Anne</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Designs for houses did not improve in beauty as the
eighteenth century went on. Many of the houses were
very substantially built, and were arranged with an eye
to comfort and convenience. The hall, which had been
the centre of the old English home, became smaller and
smaller; the kitchens were placed below the ground-level,
and in towns were often reached by a flight of steps down
from the street to the area, which is still so common in
London streets.</p>

<p>The front door of the house became the great ornamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
feature of the building, approached by a flight of
steps often protected by very handsome iron railings.
Attached to many of the railings still are light upright
posts for carrying an old-fashioned oil-lamp. Just a few
of these lamp-carriers have extinguishers, which were
for the use of the link-boys, when on dark nights they
had safely lighted the master of the house through the
dangers of the streets to his own front door.</p>

<p>The brickwork of these houses had become very plain,
and less and less stone was used for ornament&mdash;a little
over the principal windows, and the boldly cut quoins at
the angles of the house. Most of the windows were
merely oblong openings in the blank wall.</p>

<p>The great point aimed at was to get a handsome doorway.
Sometimes a portico was built out, supported by
stone pillars having richly-carved capitals. In other
cases a canopy, supported by half-columns, or by
brackets, was placed over the doorway. Stone was
sometimes used for these canopies, but wood was more
common. These wooden canopies and brackets are
often very fine pieces of joinery and wood-carving.
The canopy sometimes takes the form of a kind of big
shell, the ornaments and pattern being finely moulded,
and the cornice being deeply and boldly cut. These
canopies were painted, and the tops covered with lead
to protect them from the weather. As you walk along
streets of an old town, which has not been too much
modernized, you will be almost sure to see some specimens
of this kind of work.</p>

<p>The thick panelled doors of these houses are often
grand pieces of work, which would rejoice the heart
of a joiner who loves his craft. So many boys now
are taught something of joinery at school that there
must be a good many of them who know enough to
see the beauty there is in a good piece of work, even
though it may be quite plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Another feature in these doorways is the window over
the door, intended to give light to the hall. We call it
the fan-light, because it was usually made somewhat in
the shape of an open fan, and you will find in fan-lights
some very pretty designs cleverly put together.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century stucco
came into fashion. It was easy to handle, and ornamental
patterns could be readily produced. The ornamental
stone and woodwork was imitated in plaster.
Like all mere imitations of good work, it soon became
poor, and showed itself to be a sham; but it was very
fashionable. There was such a rage for it that the brickwork
of a house was often covered with a smooth coat of
it, and the whole painted white, or cream colour. Some
of the old houses of good sound brick were covered in
this way, and it was often used to cover up very poor
bricks and brickwork. Good plaster-work, no doubt,
often served a purpose in keeping out damp, but it
was very formal, and not very beautiful.</p>

<div><a name="doorway_from_a_house_in_gt_ormond_street_london" id="doorway_from_a_house_in_gt_ormond_street_london"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Doorway from a House in Gt. Ormond Street, London, now in the

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
In the middle of the same century a fancy for Gothic
architecture revived, and many brick buildings were
built with pointed arches, doorways, and windows, with
turrets and pinnacles, all covered with plaster-work and
cement, imitating Gothic mouldings and carvings; but
it was only sham Gothic, and not at all satisfactory.</p>

<p>Indeed, we may say that, as the century went on,
houses did not become more beautiful. As the population
increased in the town, streets of houses sprang
up, some large, some small, built in rows and crescents
and terraces, in which all the houses were alike; and
very dull and drab and mean-looking many of them
have become. When they were built they were made
to look neat, or even smart, in front, but little care was
taken about the appearance and convenience of their
backs. They were not arranged in such a way that
each might have a proper amount of light, and that
a free current of air could pass through them and
around them.</p>

<p>In some respects we have improved our houses, but
we have much to learn yet. We have, for instance,
yet to see that <em>all</em> our houses, however small, shall
have a proper number of bedrooms, large, light, and
airy&mdash;for we spend one-third of our lives in them. We
have also to see that both beauty and fitness shall be
properly considered in building a house. Too often
no care is taken to provide proper places where food
and clothing can be kept, and where that very necessary
but unpleasant process of washing and drying of
clothes can be carried on without spoiling the comfort
and health of the household. Every house needs a
bathroom of some sort, as much as a grate; for where
dirt is there is disease, suffering, and death. We are
thinking very much in these days about the absolute
need for better housing of the people; indeed, that is
one of the "big problems" which we have to tackle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV<br />
Building after the Restoration: Churches</h2>

<p>After the Reformation the churches, as we have said,
were much neglected for a long time. They were used
in a different way from what they had been in the Middle
Ages&mdash;a great deal more was thought of preaching and
hearing sermons. People grew to be very particular
as to where they sat in church, and to have a seat in
accordance with their dignity and importance. Pews
became very important things. Churches were not
heated in those days, though the services were very
long, for sermons often lasted for an hour or two. No
doubt one reason for making pews so high was to keep
off draughts. The great people of the parish seemed to
try to outdo each other in the height of their pews.
Some of the grand pews had canopies to them, like old-fashioned
four-post bedsteads, and they were hung
round with curtains. In later times they even had fireplaces,
with "poker, tongs, and shovel" all complete.</p>

<p>Gradually the whole floor-space got filled up with
pews with high wooden walls, some square, some
oblong, all shut in with doors, and with seats running
round them. A little girl who was once taken to a
church which was fitted with these "horse-box" pews,
when she came home told her mother: "We went into a
cupboard and sat on a shelf!" The fashion of having
pews shut in with doors lasted for several centuries;
indeed you may see them still in some churches, though
they are not nearly as high as they once were.</p>

<p>The churches needed repairs from time to time in the
seventeenth century, and a few, a very few, new ones
were built. But money was not spent upon them as it
had been in the Middle Ages. They were patched up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and mended for the most part as cheaply as possible.
In very few cases was any attempt made to make them
as beautiful as the houses which were being built at the
time.</p>

<div><a name="pews_in_a_church_at_stokesay_shropshire_rebuilt_1654" id="pews_in_a_church_at_stokesay_shropshire_rebuilt_1654"></a></div>

<img class="mw" src="images/i_186.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Pews in a Church at Stokesay, Shropshire, rebuilt 1654</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>After the Restoration there arose a great interest in
bells and bell-ringing. At the end of the seventeenth
century a great many rings of bells were hung in the
old steeples and belfries, which had to be altered to
receive them.</p>

<p>The monuments set up in the churches in the reign of
King Charles II were somewhat smaller than they had
been. They were often tablets on the walls, ornamented
with curious carvings of skulls and cross-bones, cherubs'
heads, curtains, and festoons of flowers and fruits, often
finely carved. You will not find in churchyards many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
grave-stones or tombs of an earlier date than 1660. The
head-stones were then very small, and had little on
them except "Here lyeth the body of" so-and-so, and
the date.</p>

<p>A great many churches were built in London after
the Fire. They were furnished with high pews, usually
all of the same height, and having doors. The woodwork,
especially of the pulpit, reading-desk, and organ-case,
in these churches is mostly very fine. A celebrated
carver of this period was Grinling Gibbons, and he and
his pupils did a great deal of such work, both in churches
and houses.</p>

<p>In other parts of the country Wren's work was imitated
in some of the new churches then built, and in some of
the old ones which were altered or rearranged. One of
the best specimens of work done at this time is to be
seen in Whitchurch, in Middlesex.</p>

<p>Not very many new churches, however, were built
until the beginning of the nineteenth century, except
in some of the towns which had grown up from country
villages. In and round London most of the villages
increased so much in size that the little old parish
church was much too small for the population. Galleries
were put up in them in all sorts of queer places, to
provide more seats. More room still being wanted,
many churches were pulled down, and larger buildings
set up.</p>

<p>The new churches of the latter part of the eighteenth
and the early years of the nineteenth centuries were
simply big oblong rooms. The outsides were often
copies of parts of Grecian temples. They were crowned
with towers and spires somewhat like those on Wren's
churches, but not nearly so handsome.</p>

<p>Although not considered one of Wren's best interiors, it gives a good idea of the classical detail and carving employed
by the architect. The position of the pulpit, organ, and seats have been altered since Wren's time</p>
</div></div>

<p>Inside, the church was fitted up with a gallery running
along two sides and across one end. In the end gallery
a big organ was placed, and on either side of it, high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
up, near the ceiling, were smaller galleries, one for the
charity-school boys, the other for the charity-school
girls of the parish. The galleries and floor of the church
were filled with high pews. On the floor opposite the
organ were three huge boxes, rising one above the other.
The lowest box was for the parish clerk, the middle one
was the reading-desk, and the highest was the pulpit,
which was often provided with a sounding-board, not
unlike an umbrella. The altar was in a little niche
behind the pulpit. Chapels were fitted up in much the
same way.</p>

<p>Under all these churches and chapels were vaults, in
which people were buried, but not in the earth. The
coffins were placed on shelves, one above the other,
round the vault. On the walls of the church above
were often tablets to the memory of people lying in the
vaults below. These, by the nineteenth century, were
for the most part simply slabs of white marble, with
black or grey borders. There was hardly any carving
at all on them; only inscriptions or epitaphs, and texts.</p>

<p>The churchyards were used for burials, and by the
middle of the nineteenth century most of them were
crowded with tombstones. In London nearly all are
now laid out in open spaces; many of the grave-stones
have quite disappeared, and those which remain are
rapidly perishing.</p>

<p>When we remember that the churchyards of the old
churches had been used as burial-places in many cases
since the early days of Christianity, and even before
that, we can easily grasp the fact that the earth had
been used over and over again for burials. About the
middle of the nineteenth century the nation came to
the conclusion that burials in churches and crowded
town churchyards should no longer be allowed. The
practice was dangerous to the living. So cemeteries
were opened in districts away from the towns and homes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the people. Towns have grown so fast that many of
these cemeteries are now surrounded by houses, and in
the midst of big populations.</p>

<p>About the year 1840 interest began to be taken in the
old English styles of building, and a taste for Gothic
architecture arose again. Since that time places of
worship of all descriptions have for the most part been
built in some sort of Gothic. When you read that such
and such a church or building is in the fourteenth-or
fifteenth-century style, you must understand that it is
not a copy of a church built in the fourteenth or fifteenth
century, but that its window-heads, doorways, arches,
and fittings are <em>in the style</em> of the fourteenth or fifteenth
century. Most of these modern buildings are of brick,
only faced or dressed with stone. It is pretty safe to say
that there is no old church standing which was built
entirely in the fourteenth century, and has remained
unaltered from that day to this. Nearly all the old
churches have been restored, a good many of them
several times during the last sixty or seventy years.
Unfortunately, through ignorance, a good many interesting
features in the old buildings were swept away during
these "restorations". An old building needs very careful
handling when we set about repairing it.</p>

<p>In our towns almost every tower and spire which we
see is a modern building, though the <em>styles</em> may vary
from Norman to Perpendicular and seventeenth century.
Modern buildings, churches, halls, public offices, and
private houses are mostly imitations of the work of past
ages. There is no nineteenth-century style of English
architecture. Some day, perhaps, England may develop
a new style of architecture, such as the world has never
yet seen, but at the present time we seem to be only able
to copy and adapt the work of those who have gone
before us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV<br />
Schools after the Reformation</h2>

<p>A little of the property which had belonged to the
religious houses was saved and turned to useful purposes.
Just a very few of the old alms-houses were
allowed to continue their work, like St. Cross at Winchester,
and some schools and colleges were founded.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of such schools which bear
the name of King Edward the Sixth. But Edward VI
was only a lad of sixteen when he died, and he had
practically nothing to do with either the good or the
evil which was done in his name. In other towns besides
London, good men set to work and managed to get
grants of some small parts of the property of old religious
houses, and adapted them for school work. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
some instances they were allowed to have part of an
old ruin, which they patched up and turned into a
schoolroom, and some of these queer old rooms continued
in use for many generations. At St. Alban's
the lady chapel at the east end of the Abbey Church
was walled off from the main building in the time of
Edward VI, and from that time it was used as the
Grammar School until about a third of a century ago.</p>

<p>It is quite true to say that a good number of our
present grammar-schools rose out of the ashes of the
monasteries. But they were not great buildings intended
for hundreds of scholars. Many of them were
founded for ten or a dozen scholars drawn from a particular
town or district. The sum set apart for the
upkeep of the schools was usually very small, and not
always readily forthcoming. The master was always
a man who had taken a degree at one of the universities,
but his salary was so small that he had to engage in
other work as well in order to make a living. If he
was an enthusiastic teacher, in some cases he attracted
scholars from outside, who were not on the foundation,
from whom he got fees, and in this way he increased
his income, and was able to make a living. Some
schools had an usher as well as the master; and at
times when the number of scholars was very small they
were left to the usher, the master devoting his time to
other work, and only drawing the salary due to him.
In such cases the school fell to a low ebb, the number
of scholars dwindled, and the buildings were allowed to
fall to decay. All of them had their ups and downs;
at times doing good work, at others doing very little
at all. That went on for many years. However, most
of them are alive and active to-day, and many of them
have histories of which they may be proud, and a past
which should help them to excel in the future.</p>

<p>Children were often taught in the church and church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
porch in country places. John Evelyn was so taught in
the early part of the seventeenth century, and many more
people could read and write than we sometimes imagine;
but knowledge was not within the reach of all.</p>

<p>The condition of the poor occupied a good deal of
attention, and the poor laws were used to improve
matters in many ways. At Norwich, for instance, in
the year 1632, a children's hospital was provided for
boys between the ages of ten and fourteen. They were
to be taught useful trades, and fed and clothed. For
dinner they were to have six ounces of bread, one pint
of beer, and, on three days of the week, one pint of
pottage and six ounces of beef; on the four other days,
one ounce of butter and two ounces of cheese. For
supper they were to have six ounces of bread, one pint
of beer, one ounce of butter, and two ounces of cheese.
For breakfast every day they had three ounces of bread,
half an ounce of butter, and a half-pint of beer.</p>

<p>About the year 1686 the Middlesex magistrates established
what they called a "College for Infants". This
is what they said about their plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Justices, having observed great inconveniences
from the loose upbringing of parish children whereby
very few of them come to good. Order made that a
great part of the Corporation House is fitted up for that
purpose, and excellent rules and methods are therein
taken for their education in true religion and virtue.
Order made for the parishes to send fifty children in all."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, and in
the early part of the eighteenth century, we find another
sort of school coming into existence&mdash;the charity-schools.
These were intended to give a simpler sort of education
than that which the grammar-schools were supposed to
give. They were intended for what was called the
poorer classes. Now in the grammar-schools it was
essential that the master should be a man of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
learning and standing&mdash;he must have taken a degree
at one of the universities. But in these charity-schools
it was not thought to be essential that the teacher should
have both learning and the ability to teach. They were
managed by governors, who drew up rules and regulations
as to what was to be done in the schools, and it
was the teacher's business just to carry out these regulations
as best he could. So there was much learning
by rote. There was reading, in which the Bible was
the chief, sometimes the only, reading-book, a certain
amount of writing, and a little arithmetic. Where the
master happened to be a person of ability, some good
work was done. Writing was often very carefully and
thoroughly taught, and the handwriting was far in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
advance of most of the abominable stuff which we
scribble in these days and make do duty for writing.
The girls were taught needlework, and had to spend
long hours every day at the task. It is very interesting
to read through the old order-books kept by the
governors of these old-fashioned schools, and to glean
from them something of the daily life in these humble
schools. The rules and regulations made from time to
time seem to us very strange and even ridiculous, and
it is a very easy matter to make fun out of them. But
we must remember that at the time they were drawn up
the worthy governors had very good reasons for what
they did, and we cannot but honour them for doing their
best according to their lights. There were charity-schools
in almost every town and in a good many
villages; some founded by bodies of men, others by
private individuals. The buildings varied according to
the amount of money which the governors had to spend
upon them. Some are very picturesque buildings. For
instance, there is the Dewhurst School at Cheshunt,
founded in 1640, and Mrs. Lucie Fuller's School at
Watford, founded in 1704.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The scholars of these schools attended daily, on
Sundays as well as workdays. On Sundays and some
other days they were all marched off to church, where
they sat in dreadful little galleries built mostly high
up in dark corners on either side of the organ. These
charity-schools were carried on in much the same way
right down to the middle of the nineteenth century.
The scholars were mostly dressed in the costume of
the period at which the school was founded; and very
quaint and curious they looked. Almost the last link
now left of such dress is that in which a "Bluecoat
Boy" may still be seen. That dress is a relic of the
dress worn in the middle of the sixteenth century. The
little charity-school boys wore leather breeches&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
in later times were altered mostly to corduroy&mdash;coloured
stockings; coats of a quaint cut with funny little tails
at the back, of brown or green or grey or black cloth,
and round, flat caps in colours to match their coats;
pewter or brass badges on their breasts, bearing the
name or device or the arms of the school, and two little
pieces of fine linen fluttering under their chins, called
"bands". This was the ordinary boys' dress in the
eighteenth century, and the charity-school boys continued
to wear it long after it had gone out of fashion. The
charity-school girls had frocks and cloaks of a wonderful
cut, in colours corresponding with the boys' coats; white
tippets, aprons, and "such mob caps". In church they
led the singing, what little there was, and their hours
in school were long, very long, but they found time
to get in a fair amount of play, and had plenty of time
for getting into mischief as the order-books of the
governors bear witness.</p>

<p>People often laugh at these old-fashioned charity-schools
and speak of them with contempt.
That is absolutely a wrong thing to do,
because they were founded many years
before Parliament troubled itself about
the education of the people. We cannot
too greatly honour those worthy old-fashioned
men and women who did what
they could to provide some teaching and
training for poor boys and girls, and to
put them in the way of earning their
own living.</p>

<p>By the end of the eighteenth century
people were beginning to be concerned
at the ignorance of the great masses of
the people in this country, and we find
that in a good many places little schools
were being kept, taught by the parish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
clerk or by some old lady; and here and there we find
attempts being made to form parish schools. These
were for the most part on the same lines as the older
charity-schools, but maintained by subscriptions from
private persons.</p>

<p>In the first year of the nineteenth century, Joseph
Lancaster, a member of the Society of Friends, took
over a big disused barn in the Borough Road, London,
and set up this inscription over the door:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All who wish may send their children and have
them educated freely; and those who do not wish to
have their education for nothing may pay for it if
they please."</p>

<p>He tried to teach, and keep in order, several hundred
children at the same time. He had them arranged in
little classes of seven or eight children spelling out
verses from the Bible, printed on large cards, under
the guidance of an older child. Groups of these little
classes were under the charge of an older child still,
called a superintendent. Writing was taught in little
classes, the children tracing the forms of the letters
in sand, strewn on flat benches. Everything was
regulated by rule, and done at words of command,
given by the head teacher.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A few years later, a churchman, Dr. Bell, started
a somewhat similar method of instruction, by means
of monitors, which he had tried in Madras some thirty
years before.</p>

<div><a name="schoolmaster_and_pupils_early_seventeenth_century" id="schoolmaster_and_pupils_early_seventeenth_century"></a></div>

</div></div>

<p>Those were the beginnings of the primary schools
of to-day. From Lancaster's work there sprang a
society, called the "British and Foreign School Society",
and from Bell's work another, known as the "National
Society". These two societies set to work vigorously
to see what they could do to improve education and
to promote the building of schools. They very soon
found that the great need was for teachers, trained for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
this special work&mdash;folk
who not only had
knowledge as to <em>what</em>
to teach, but also who
had been trained <em>how</em>
to teach. That was the
beginning of a new
order of teachers, and
Training Colleges for
Teachers was the outcome
of their efforts.
These private societies
led the way in the face
of much opposition;
for there were hosts of
people who "didn't see
why" there should be
all this fuss about the
education of the masses
of the people. At last,
after much difficulty, in the year 1833, Parliament made
a grant of twenty thousand pounds to these two societies,
to be used by them in the work of building schools.
That was the beginning of State Grants for Education.</p>

<p>Then in various parts of the country people were
stirred to build schools, aided by grants and advice
of these societies; and that was the beginning of our
modern schoolrooms. In 1839 Parliament really took
in hand the work of Education, and Inspectors of
Schools were appointed, and the Education Department
set up to look after the work of Education in the
country. Much was left for private individuals to do;
but, from that time, the work has gone forward slowly,
and the State has taken a greater part in the work.
In 1870 a great step forward was taken, and again and
again since then things have moved onward; and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
last, in 1918, another Education Act was passed which
aims at making the Education of the Nation more than
it has ever yet been one of the very first duties of the
State.</p>

<p>The school buildings which the two societies set on
foot in the course of time have become unsuitable for
the work to be done in them, and changes have had
to take place. Since 1870 a very large number of new
school buildings have been erected; but changing times
already call for many alterations to suit them for the
fresh methods of carrying on the work in the best
interests of those who have to be taught in them. So
many things have to be considered now of which we
knew but very little in the days gone by, and we can
never sit down and say that the work is complete, and
that no more improvements can be made.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI<br />
Apprentices</h2>

<p>From many of these old-fashioned schools boys and
girls were apprenticed. Connected with old parishes
there are still funds for placing out boys and girls to
trades and crafts. All through the Middle Ages, and
right on into modern times, children were set to work
when quite young, and it was a common custom to send
them away from home for this purpose. The children
of the upper classes, the boys especially, were trained in
the households of other nobles and squires. The idea
was to bring them up "hardy", though to us it seems
a somewhat unnatural way of doing it. An Italian,
who visited England about the year 1500, was much
struck by this English custom, and he did not at all
approve of such young children being given over to the
bringing up by strangers. Both boys and girls from
quite well-to-do homes were very often thus sent out,
when they were between seven and nine years of age,
and apprenticed for seven or nine years, not only to
learn some trade or craft, but to private houses where
they were set to do menial and drudging work of all
sorts. The idea was "that they might learn better
manners" than they would do at home. In many wealthy
homes it is still the practice to send boys to boarding-school
when they reach ten years of age for the greater
part of each year, away from home and home influence,
before they are sent on to a public school and, later, to
a university.</p>

<p>All through the Middle Ages the only way by which
a man could become a craftsman was by being first of
all an apprentice, and the rules by which a lad was
bound to a master were very strict. Things did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
alter much in this respect in the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries. An apprentice was always
bound for seven years in the presence of magistrates.
The master had to find his apprentice in food, clothing,
lodging, and to instruct him in his art, or "mystery"
as it was called. The apprentice lived in his master's
house, and was bound to serve him.</p>

<div><a name="apprentice_sixteenth_century" id="apprentice_sixteenth_century"></a></div>
<div class="image-right">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Apprentice, Sixteenth Century. From</i><br />
<i>a contemporary woodcut</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>His master could chastise him if he was idle or
"saucy", and even have him sent to the house of correction
for further punishment. Both masters and
apprentices could complain of each other to the magistrates
at the Quarter Sessions, and the hearing of the
complaints often took up a lot of time. According to
many of the complaints, of which records still exist,
some of the apprentices must have had rather a hard
time&mdash;"seven years, hard". Some complained of having
to eat mouldy cheese and rotten meat; others, of
their ragged clothes; others, that their masters beat
them with pokers, hammers, pint-pots, to say nothing of
whips and sticks; prevented them from going to church;
and others, that their masters
turned them out of doors, or
ran away and left them. The
masters, on their side, often
complain that their apprentices
are idle, that they rob
them, that they stop out at
night and keep company
with bad characters, and so
on. So it seems they did
not always get on well together.</p>

<p>But then there were the
others&mdash;those who made the
best of it. Where the
master did his duty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the apprentice took pains to learn, they got on pretty
well together. It was not an easy life for the apprentice,
but it made him a craftsman.</p>

<p>The children of those who belonged to the poorer
classes were apprenticed to unskilled occupations in a
similar way, and if the parents neglected to do this the
parish authorities interfered and found places and
masters for them.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country there were little schools
where children were taught straw-plait and lace-making.
Some of these lasted right down to days which people
still living can remember, in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII<br />
Play</h2>

<p>In all the many centuries of our history there have
been boys and girls; and, whatever has been going on
in the world around them, they have found time to play.
In the Great War our soldiers could not but be struck
by the way in which the children in places under bombardment
took advantage of any lull in the firing to
come out of their hiding places, and go on with their
games, in spite of the ruin and desolation and danger
all round them.</p>

<p>Many of our English games go back so far in the
history of man that their origin is forgotten. Yet there
are games which children play now just as they did in
the days of Queen Elizabeth; and those queer rhymes,
which you know so well, and understand nothing about,
have been repeated, some of them, since England began
to be England.</p>

<p>There is plenty to say about games, but not enough
space to say it all here. There are some games which
come and go as regularly as the seasons. The queer part
of it all is: Who starts the game? As sure as the early
spring evenings arrive you will find boys playing at
marbles. Town or country, it does not matter, all at
once "marbles are <em>in</em>". Nobody says it is "marble
season"; nobody ever yet found the boy who brings out
the first marble of the season. Somehow a <em>something</em>
inside a boy tells him it is "marble" time, and the
marbles appear in his pocket.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>The Game of Bob-apple, Fourteenth</i><br />
<i>Century. From an illustration in a manuscript</i><br />
<i>in the British Museum</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>It is just the same with "tops"; they come and they
go with absolute regularity. They come as if by magic,
and by magic they disappear. When the errand-boy,
who has left school a month or two, stops, basket on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
arm, to watch the game, you may be sure that it is the
height of the season. When the ground is occupied by
the little chaps who have just come up from the infant
school, and the errand-boy passes whistling by on the
other side, it is quite certain that the season is over and
gone.</p>

<p>These are games that want no clubs, associations, nor
subscriptions. Yet they are governed by time-honoured
rules, which have never been written down, but must be
strictly observed, or there is much talking and wrangling
over the game.</p>

<p>Sports have an important place in the life of towns
and villages nowadays; but, though cricket and football
are old games really, they have not always been as
popular as they are now. Cricket, in some form or
other, was played in the thirteenth century when it was
played with a crooked or clubbed stick called a "cryc".
Indeed all games where a ball is used are more or less
ancient. It seems to have been played at Guildford as
early as 1598, but
modern cricket only
dates from the middle
of the eighteenth century.
Kent seems to
have led the way, and
Hampshire was the
home of the game in
1774.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Tennis, or "fives"
was a favourite game
for many centuries, and
it was quite a common
thing in some places for
it to be played against
the church tower, which
was a very convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
place for the game. Complaints were frequently made
of the damage done to and around the churches by the
playing of unlawful and disordered games of many
kinds. At times attempts were made to put down the
playing of tennis. But by the time of Queen Elizabeth
it had come into favour, and the privilege of keeping
tennis-courts was eagerly sought for, and the game
became very popular indeed later on; but it went out
of fashion again towards the end of the eighteenth century,
only to be revived again in our own times.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is only within the last forty years that football
has become popular. Football of some kind has been
played for many centuries, especially in the streets of
towns. Kingston, Chester, and Dorking, amongst other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
places, have a custom of playing football on Shrove
Tuesday. The story as to how the custom arose is
the same in most of these places.</p>

<p>Far back in the ninth century a party of Danes
ravaged the district and attacked the town. The townsmen
made a brave stand against them till help came.
Then the Danes were defeated, their leader slain, his
head struck off, and kicked about the streets in triumph.
That is said to have given rise to the custom; but it
was a very ghastly football.</p>

<div><a name="diagrams_of_layouts_for_a_boys_game" id="diagrams_of_layouts_for_a_boys_game"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Diagrams of Layouts</i><br /> <i>for a Boy's Game</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Football was not always regarded with favour. Folk
often wanted to play football when their lords and masters
wanted them to practise shooting with their bows and
arrows; but they were frequently told what a dangerous
game it was, and over and over again it was forbidden.
Football was always apparently a game over which the
players fell out, much as they do now. Nearly four hundred
years ago a worthy gentleman wrote of the game:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is nothyng but beastely fury and extreme violence,
whereby procedeth hurte, and consequently rancour and
malice do remayne with thym that be wounded".</p>

<p>There are some places where the schoolboys of long,
long ago have left their marks. In the cloisters at Westminster
Abbey, at Canterbury, at Norwich, at Salisbury
and at Gloucester Cathedral, for instance, are some roughly
cut marks in the old benches, forming the
"tables" or "boards" on which they played
some almost forgotten games with stones.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is "hop-scotch" which at
some seasons of the year makes the sidewalks
of many bye-streets so untidy with
its rudely chalked courts; rounders and
"tip-cat"; battledore and shuttlecock, to
say nothing of skipping and many another
game&mdash;all old, old games, which are ever
new, and never out of date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII<br />
Roads</h2>

<p>All roads lead to London and have done so for many
a century, and so we find, as we should expect to do,
that roads from all parts of the country converge towards
it like the spokes of a wheel to its centre. The
same sort of thing is seen in all towns of any size.
Cross roads connect these main roads, and the nearer
we are to the town the greater is the number of these,
and they are often as busy and as important as the
old main roads. But as we get away from the towns
into the more rural districts, the lesser roads which
connect the villages and hamlets with each other become
fewer, more winding and straggling. There are
also green lanes and field paths, and it is by following
these, rather than the high roads, that the real beauties
of the country can be seen. A person dashing along
the main road in a motor-car, on a motor-cycle or a
bicycle misses much which a man on foot, who is not
in a tremendous hurry, is able to see and enjoy.</p>

<p>Not very long after the Romans left Britain, and the
raids of Saxon tribes began to be felt, the roads, which
during the Roman times had been kept in good repair,
were neglected. Some of them gradually dropped out
of use, and in the course of time grass, brushwood, and
trees grew close up to the track and in places covered
it, and it became in time a "lost" road. The roads
which remained in use, through neglect grew worse and
worse, and all through the Middle Ages very little was
done to mend them. Travellers for the most part
journeyed on horseback, and trains of mules and packhorses
transported goods. Later on heavy wagons,
drawn by teams of eight, ten, or a dozen horses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
used, and frequently extra teams had to be hitched on
at places where they got into difficulties and came
to grief owing to the badness of the road. Often these
long trains of wagons had to be "convoyed" by bands
of armed men on horseback. To repair "foul and
noyous highways" was regarded as a work of mercy,
and we often find good people in the Middle Ages
leaving money in their wills to be bestowed on the
repair of a part of a highway. The religious houses
in many cases were expected to keep up good roads in
their own neighbourhood. There was once a hermit,
who lived at Highgate, near London. He, at his own
cost, had gravel dug from the top of Highgate Hill,
and with it made a causeway down in the "hollow
way" between Highgate and Islington. In the fourteenth
century the Bishop of London made a way through his
park at Highgate Hill across Finchley Common to
Whetstone, near Barnet, because the highway was
in such a dreadful condition. Those who used this
road had to pay a toll.</p>

<div><a name="cart_fourteenth_century" id="cart_fourteenth_century"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Cart, Fourteenth Century</i></p>
<p><i>From an illuminated manuscript in the Bodleian Library, Oxford</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries the various
parishes were expected to look after the parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
great roads which ran through them, the landlords
and tenants being required, according to the size of
their holdings, to furnish men and horses, wagons
and barrows, to work on the highways for so many
days in each year. But for some centuries the work
was done in a very shiftless, casual manner. The people
in the parishes grumbled and did as little as they could,
for, as they said, it was not they who wore out the roads,
but the travellers from a distance who came backwards
and forwards with all their heavy loads.</p>

<p>Traffic increased as the time went on, and it became
necessary to provide for the wants of the many travellers
along the roads. The old villages in very many cases stood
away from the highways, and so we find new hamlets
springing up on the main roads, and some of the new
towns, like Uxbridge, Brentford, and Edgware in
Middlesex, and Buntingford in Hertfordshire, had their
origin in this way. Similar instance will be found in
most other counties.</p>

<p>In Queen Elizabeth's reign the roads all over the
country were bad; in some parts, owing to the nature
of the soil, particularly bad. In the south, in the Weald
district, the iron workers were ordered to mend their
roads with the cinders from their furnaces, as the stone
found in that neighbourhood was too soft for the purpose.
But the roads did not greatly improve although
the amount of traffic upon them increased.</p>

<p>Coaches came into use for long-distance travelling in
the reign of Charles II. One began to run regularly
between London and Bath in 1667&mdash;a three-days' journey
if no accidents happened&mdash;and another started running
from London to Portsmouth in the following year. About
the middle of the eighteenth century every week there
passed through the Borough from London on the way
south, a hundred and forty-three stage-coaches, a hundred
and twenty-one wagons, and a hundred and ninety-six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
carts and caravans. That was only the out-going
traffic, there was quite as much traffic returning to the
City.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1754 that a great improvement
of roads began through the passing of the Turnpike
Acts. The idea was that those people who actually
used the roads should bear the cost of their upkeep,
and companies, or "trusts", were formed to look after
certain roads, have them properly made, and kept in
repair. At certain distances along the road, a few
miles apart, gates were set across the road with a little
house by each, in which the toll-gate keeper lived,
whose duty it was to open and close the gate to travellers
and take the specified toll. Different kinds of
vehicles had to pay different sums as toll, and so had
flocks of sheep and droves of cattle when being moved
from one part of the country to another. People actually
living in the neighbourhood had certain rights to use
the way toll free. The toll-gate keeper was usually a
"crusty" person&mdash;a sort of spider lying in wait to catch

flies&mdash;and very often when a traveller drove up to the
gate in a hurry, anxious to get through, the toll-man
would be particularly slow in opening the gates and in
giving change.</p>

<p>Most of the main roads were thus improved, but not
all of them. As late as the year 1797 the turnpike road
through Uxbridge, which carried a very large traffic,
was very bad indeed. There was only one track which
could be used in winter and that was eight inches deep
in slush and mud. Still, on the whole, the roads were
improving and coaches were able to travel more quickly.</p>

<p>Mail-coaches were put on the road in 1785, and they
increased in speed and in numbers as the years went on,
until just before the advent of railways. Over ninety
coaches a day passed through Whetstone Turnpike,
near Barnet; and in 1821 there were coaches which
did the seventy-two miles between London and Portsmouth
in ten hours. It was the same on all the great
roads, and the coaches were only one part of the traffic.</p>

<p>In the "good old coaching days", noblemen and
great folk travelled the long distances in their family
coaches in great state, attended by servants; some
riding before and after on horseback, and some hanging
on behind the coach. Other wealthy people used to
travel "post", and the carriages used were called "post-chaises".
These were drawn by four or six horses, with
a "post-boy" or postilion to each pair of horses. No
matter how old he might be he was always called a
post-boy. A great many old-established inns all over
the country are still called "posting-houses". At these
inns such carriages and horses to draw them, and post-boys
to drive them, could be hired. These houses were
about ten miles apart, and that distance was called a
"stage"; and in posting the horses were changed at
each "house" along the road. Nowadays, by the name
posting-house we understand an inn where vehicles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
horses can be hired; but probably not one of them could
turn out a post-chaise, four horses and a couple of
post-boys, at five minutes' notice.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div></div>

<p>The railways gradually drove the coaches and the post-chaises
off the roads, but the introduction of cycles in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century, and the motor-car
at the beginning of the twentieth century have revived
the use of the highways for traffic, and there is a
great time for the old roads just ahead of us to-day.</p>

<p>There were many varieties of inns, often quite close
together, from the big posting-houses down to the
obscure little ale-house. These houses accommodated
various classes of traffic. Even now, if you live near
to one of the big main roads you will notice that some
wagons draw up at particular houses on the road for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
"refreshment of man and beast"&mdash;the hay-carts have
their own special stopping places, and so, too, have
other sorts of heavy traffic; and they have kept to
the custom of the road from one generation to another.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>THE NEW INN, GLOUCESTER From an engraving

</div></div>

<p>The old inns are often very picturesque buildings and
there are some famous ones in every county. The
curious names by which they are known is a study in
itself, and quite an interesting one.</p>

<p>Many of the old inns fell on evil days as the introduction
of railways gradually absorbed most of the road
traffic, and many of them were closed or turned into
private houses. In the last quarter of the nineteenth
century life on the ancient highways began to revive
through the introduction of cycling as a means of locomotion.
Cycling became very common, and, by
specially catering for cyclists a good number of these
old inns came again to prosperous times. With the
dawn of the twentieth century motor-cars came on the
road, and still further brought the highways into use.
But these raised "clouds of dust" and tore up the roads,
and it became a great problem how to make the roads
suitable for this new sort of traffic, and a good deal was
done which improved their surface greatly. Then came
the Great War, and a continuous stream of heavier
motor-traffic had to be put upon the roads throughout
the country to supply the huge camps at home and overseas,
and the many new towns which have sprung up
in districts which, a few years ago, were quiet, unfrequented
places. There is an enormous amount of
work to be done now in re-making the present roads and
tracks, and to provide for many new ones as well. We
now realize that rapid means of transit for both people
and goods will have to be provided on a far larger scale
than we have hitherto attempted, if the resources of the
country are to be properly developed. Roads, more
roads, better roads are an urgent necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX<br />
Roads&mdash;Railways</h2>

<p>In speaking of the roads in the last chapter, we have
come right down to the present day and its needs; but
we must go back a bit, as far as time is concerned, to
say something about one special class of road which has
played an important part in the making of England.
The story of the roads began before the dawn of written
history&mdash;ages and ages before. The story of the railways
belongs, as we may say, only to yesterday.</p>

<p>When we speak of a railway in these days we picture
to our minds a trackway, laid with parallel steel rails,
along which long trains of carriages and trucks are
drawn by a locomotive engine. The engine, indeed, is
the first thing that a boy thinks of in connection with
a railway; and no wonder, for the "iron horse" is a
marvellous and interesting piece of machinery. But in
the history of our modern railways the <em>trackway</em>, or the
<em>rail-way</em> proper, comes first. There were railways long
before there were locomotive engines; indeed, we shall
not be far out if we say that there were railways in England
a few centuries before steam-engines of any sort
came into use.</p>

<p>It was up in the North, in the colliery districts by the
Tyne, that the idea of tramways, along which trains of
trucks, drawn by horses or mules, seem to have first
come into use; and they can certainly be traced there
as far back as the time of King Charles I (about the year
1630). The first railway which Parliament allowed to
be laid in the South of England was the "Surrey Iron
Railway". This connected Croydon with Wandsworth,
and, later on, it was extended to Merstham. That was
about the year 1801, and was intended to convey merchandise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
not passengers. For a time it was of great
service to mills and factories on the River Wandle.
That was the first railway in that part of the country,
and the trucks were drawn by donkeys!</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>George Stephenson's Locomotive "The Rocket", which at its trial trip in 1830
ran 29 miles an hour</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>A writer of that time, who thought that he was a very
wise, far-seeing man, gave it as his opinion "that it
was not probable that railways would ever come into
general use!" Well, it is never very wise to prophesy
until you really know.</p>

<p>Nearly every new invention has been scoffed at at first.
Even in this present century, when the early experiments
in the use of air-craft were being made, thousands
of persons gravely shook their heads in disapproval,
declaring that man was never intended to "fly". The
Great War time has seen wonderful developments in
air-craft, and so many "impossible" things have been
achieved that we can realize, just a little bit, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
air-craft has "a great future" before it, greater than we
can as yet grasp.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give here even a bare outline
of the story of the English Railways, but the making of
these railways and their use and development brought
about rapidly many marvellous changes which have
affected the life of the nation.</p>

<p>Seventy and eighty years ago, when railways were
first being made, they excited a great deal more attention
and interest than they do to-day. Railways were so
new then, for one thing, and there were so many of
them being made about the same time for another thing.
There are hundreds of miles of railway going through
quiet country districts, which were made many years
ago, and there are thousands of people living in those
districts who have been born since the railways were
made. To them the railway is as much an everyday
thing as the old parish church, the town pump, or the
river. So far as <em>they</em> are concerned, the line has been
always there&mdash;they never saw the country-side before
the railway came. But in the years&mdash;say between 1830
and 1860&mdash;the work was watched with much interest,
and it excited much talk, both wise and foolish.</p>

<p>What did the people who lived in a country village
see? Long before the navvies came, for years in fact,
the coming railway was talked about. The surveyor,
with his attendants, carrying theodolite and measuring-chain,
as he went about his work "taking levels", was
very narrowly watched, and his sayings and doings were
noted and discussed, time after time. In fact, not unfrequently
the surveyor and his men had some very
lively experiences, for there were lots of places in which
they were regarded with suspicion, and all sorts of tricks
were played upon them. Stephenson, when out surveying,
was threatened with more than one ducking in a
horse-pond; guns were fired at him, and he had to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
through his work at all sorts of odd times. There was
one surveyor who took a professional prize-fighter with
him as his assistant, and he found work for him to do
besides merely helping him in land-surveying. Bulls
were sometimes turned loose in the fields in which surveyors
were busy, and they had to leave in a hurry.
Surveyors were quite used to meeting with all sorts of
abuse, and being faced by angry men, armed with brickbats
and pitchforks.</p>

<p>Then, when the road was staked out, and carts and
men began to arrive, and a whole town of huts for the
workers on the railway was set up on the broad hill-side,
where the villagers and their fathers before them, time
out of mind, had ploughed, and sowed, and harrowed,
and reaped, and gleaned&mdash;tongues would wag still more,
and curiosity would be intensified. When the huts were
finished the navvies arrived. Strange folk they were to
the villagers, speaking a language of their own, and
living by themselves&mdash;strong, powerful men, doing great
deeds of strength, capable of working hard, and very
often of drinking hard, and of fighting hard. The quiet
little inns and ale-houses became noisy and busy. The
navvies brought change and excitement with them; and
also, at times, mischief, strife, confusion, and drunkenness.
For miles round the farmers would complain
that they could get no labour for farm-work. Young
men, attracted by the novelty, the higher wages, and
the greater numbers, turned navvies, "learned their
works" and left the old agricultural life of their forefathers
for ever. Then, when the navvies set to work,
the villagers saw them busy, like ants upon the hill-side,
cutting a great cleft through it, many feet in depth. As
they came along, yard by yard, they saw a rough tramway
laid, along which long trains of trucks, drawn by a
noisy, fussy little engine, were being drawn, some full
of earth and gravel or stone which had been cut away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<div><a name="building_a_railway_in_the_early_nineteenth_century" id="building_a_railway_in_the_early_nineteenth_century"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Building a Railway in the early Nineteenth Century</i></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Then, after many months' work, the men advanced
out on to the open plain. For weeks and months trains
of trucks were constantly coming laden with earth, which
was tipped on to the lower ground, forming an embankment,
which gradually came nearer and nearer the river
bank. Down by the river bank, on the far side, and on
the near side as well, were men digging for weeks at a
time. Then, these made way for an army of brick
layers and masons, and loads and loads of brick and
stone were brought along the line, or dragged by horses
through the old country lanes to the waterside. There,
on each side of the stream, what looked like big towers
were erected, as tall as the church tower, or taller perhaps,
and still the earth day by day was being brought
along the way and tipped, adding to the embankment
yard by yard. Such earth, too; clay, perhaps, or earth
of such kind as the oldest man in the parish had never
seen in those parts before, because it had been brought
from a place or places many miles away.</p>

<p>Then, when the brickwork on each side of the river was
in position, there was the building of a bridge to watch.
There were several huge arches of brick, or perhaps of
stone, brought from far-off quarries. But what were
those queer, lattice-work things, looking something like
spiders' webs, which were brought down to the waterside?
There was nothing like that ever seen in the
village before. What did it mean? They saw these
great iron lattice-work sections hoisted in the air by
steam cranes and swung slowly up and round till they
were placed in position, resting on the piers of masonry.
It must have been a wonderful sight to watch the river
being spanned by a huge bridge or by these girders,
and to see the different sections being fitted and fastened
together.</p>

<p>You may be sure that there was much shaking of
heads and many prophecies that this sort of thing was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
a flying in the face of Providence&mdash;just as in our own
time there has been over cycles, motor-cars, and air-craft.
How could those great trains and heavy engines
pass safely over such a flimsy-looking bridge as that?
It would be sure to snap in the middle. And when an
accident happened&mdash;and sad accidents did happen&mdash;many
declared that it was the Almighty's judgment
upon men for thinking that they knew better than their
fathers before them.</p>

<div><a name="sankey_valley_viaduct" id="sankey_valley_viaduct"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">

Manchester Railway (1826-9). After a contemporary painting. By permission

</div></div>

<p>So the work went on, and in time the railway became
an accomplished fact and was no longer a wonder, and
a race grew up to whom railways became part and parcel
of everyday life.</p>

<p>But the railways brought many other changes. Those
loads of earth brought from distant parts of the line not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
only altered the appearance of the country where they
were deposited, but caused other alterations as well.
Grass soon grew on the slopes of these embankments,
but with the grass came up also strange weeds and
plants. These seeded, the wind scattered the seeds,
and, in the fields on either side of the line, these new
weeds showed themselves the next season. For a year
or two, probably, nobody noticed this very particularly;
but, before very long, whole districts might be overrun
with varieties of weeds never seen in that district before.</p>

<p>In some places marshes had to be drained, and, in
consequence, many broad, shallow stretches of water
disappeared. Such "sedgy pools" in quiet districts
were once the haunt of many varieties of wild fowl. As
the pools have disappeared the wild fowl which made
these their haunt disappeared also, and with them the
wild flowers and water-plants belonging thereto have
died out as well. In much the same way insects have
been imported in the loads of earth and found a home in
a new district where they have, so to speak, "settled",
and have done in some cases good, and in other cases
harm, to the land.</p>

<p>Many cuttings through the beds of gravel and rocks
have taught us something of the changes which have
taken place in the earth's crust. It has been possible
to examine the structure of the soil of many parts of
England more thoroughly in the deep railway cuttings
and tunnels than could have been done in any other
way. Geologists have gathered much most valuable
information from the soil and rock dug out in railway
excavations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L<br />
Government</h2>

<p>There was not much change for many centuries in the
way in which towns and villages were governed.</p>

<p>The borough towns, which gained their charters back
in the days of King John, or King Henry III, had them
confirmed by various kings in later times; but the powers
of the towns were not much altered. The corporation of
a borough was usually made up of men chosen by the
freemen; but, if the freemen did not admit many persons
to the freedom of the borough, the power of electing,
in the course of years, fell into the hands of a very few
people.</p>

<p>This was what actually happened in a very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
number of cases, and at the end of the eighteenth
century there were many old boroughs which were
governed by "close corporations"&mdash;the bulk of the
people living in the borough having no voice in the
management of the affairs of the town. All that was
altered in the early part of the nineteenth century.
Many of the old boroughs lost their privileges, as they
had become such small unimportant places. All other
boroughs now have regular elections of town councillors
by the inhabitants each first of November. The councils
elect the mayor on each 9th of November.</p>

<p>The mayor, and some of the inhabitants of the
borough, are also magistrates and attend to police
cases; while the town council looks after matters connected
with sewers, lighting, paving, and cleansing
the streets of the town. It has now also charge of
educational affairs in many of the big towns, a committee
of each county council being the educational authority
in all other parts of the country.</p>

<p>In London and large towns, where there is much
police court business, there are special magistrates,
trained lawyers, who attend to nothing else.</p>

<p>In country places, for centuries, the manor court
governed the manor; but gradually, and by Tudor
times, most of the power of the manor court, or court
leet as it was sometimes called, had passed into the
hands of the Vestry. This consisted of the parish
officers and rate-payers in the whole parish. It was
called the vestry because its meeting-place was the
vestry of the parish church, or even the church itself.</p>

<div><a name="police_officer_and_jailer_early_nineteenth_century" id="police_officer_and_jailer_early_nineteenth_century"></a></div>

<div class="caption">
<p><i>Police Officer and Jailer, early Nineteenth</i><br />
<i>Century. A scene from "Oliver Twist"</i><br />
<i>(Charles Dickens)</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The relief of the poor and the care of the highways
provided the vestry with most of its business. The
churchwardens had special care of the property of the
church, but in Tudor times they were also charged
with the relief of the poor. To help them in this work
two overseers, at least, in each parish, were chosen every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
year. All the rate-payers
were liable to
serve in turn if elected,
unless they could
show a good reason
for not serving. The
elections took place
about Lady Day. The
vestry fixed what rates
were to be made, and
the overseers collected
them. But the
overseers had to be
admitted to their office,
and all rates allowed,
by two justices of the
peace, before they
were legal.</p>

<p>It became necessary,
as the poor law
business increased, to
have constables to
help the overseers in keeping an eye on strangers,
vagrants and beggars who came into the parish.
These, too, had to serve for one year. In big parishes
they were assisted by a beadle, and had, with the help
of all the inhabitants in turn, to keep watch and ward
at night. Very unpleasant work they had to do in
towns and places just outside towns. In London, and
in many other towns also, to help the "watch" there
were special officers called "watchmen", whose duty it
was to parade the streets at night at regular intervals,
and "call the hour"&mdash;"Past two o'clock, and a frosty
morning". One of their duties was to arrest any disorderly
characters whom they might come across on
their rounds. But as each watchman carried a lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
lantern that, together with the noise he made, gave
ample warning to that sort of people, who could usually,
without much difficulty, get out of the watchman's way.
When he did come upon the track of any of these gentry
he would "sound his rattle" as a signal for the "watch"
to come to his assistance, and, if they could, arrest the
offenders. This duty of watching and warding had to be
carried out until towards the middle of the nineteenth
century, when our present system of police was established.
Beadles and constables had to see to the whippings,
which were so common, and to setting people in
the stocks and the cage; to moving sick and diseased
wretches on to the next parish, and other unpleasant
duties.</p>

<p>The surveyors of the highways had to see that each
person who was liable did his share of the work of the
highways, or paid for having it done. But by far the
most important business was that of the churchwardens
and overseers. They had to settle in what houses the
poor folk were to live, who were to look after them, what
allowance was to be made for them. The poor usually
had their money paid to them at church, monthly. Then
the overseers had to see that every able-bodied man was
at work, often having to provide the work, to place out
apprentices, and to supply flax or wool for the women
and children to spin. Sometimes the poor were boarded
out; some of them lived in cottages, or in the poors'
house which the parish built. Then, too, these officers
had to relieve beggars, and persons passing through the
parish.</p>

<p>This work of providing for the poor was very difficult
and very anxious, especially at the end of the eighteenth
and in the early part of the nineteenth century. It was
quite a common practice for big parishes to "farm out"
the care of the poor to the highest bidder. That is, a
man would contract with the parish authorities to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
after the relief of the poor in that parish for a certain sum
of money per annum, for so many years.</p>

<p>Then poor law unions were formed, and union workhouses
built, in which the helpless poor might be better
cared for, and vagrants and wanderers find a night's
lodging. These were looked after by Boards of
Guardians, especially elected for that purpose. We
have not a perfect plan yet, by any means, but much
care and thought is being given to this question, and
many changes, which we hope will be improvements in
the administration of the Poor Law, are being taken in
hand. The difficulties of how to deal with the poor who,
through no fault of their own, cannot help themselves,
and how to deal with those who are lazy and will not
work, are very great.</p>

<p>The work of the old vestries has now passed to the
parish councils, the district councils, and the county
councils. The work is important, and has much to do
with the welfare of our towns and villages. We must
not expect that these bodies can do everything at once,
or that they will make no mistakes. More people now
than ever have a direct voice in the work of these various
councils, and it is the duty of everyone to take a real interest
in their work, and to strive to improve it in every
possible way. If we know something of the past history
of our towns and villages it will help us to form a right
judgment concerning difficulties which have to be met
in the present, and so to act that those who come after us
may be able to go on building upon our work, that there
may be nothing to undo, nothing to blame, but that
future years may say of our times:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They knew how to work, and they worked on right
principles." "Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI<br />
Some Changes</h2>

<p>There was not much alteration in the outward appearance
of the villages and the "look" of the country round
them for many centuries. Indeed even now many of the
villages themselves are not greatly altered in their
general arrangement. Down to the times of the Tudor
kings the old land and manor customs had gone on
since Saxon days, changing but very slowly. Many of
the class which had been villeins in the Middle Ages had
become yeomen; some had got lands of their own, and
some land on the old manors, which they rented. But
they did not alter very much the old way of treating the
land, and it was only gradually that farm-houses sprang
up away from the villages.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country these lonely farm-houses
are more common than in others. There are, for instance,
a good many in the Weald of Sussex which
sprang up first as huts in forest clearings, and afterwards
became houses with farm-buildings attached to them.</p>

<p>On the borders of great lonely heaths and commons
we can often see very old and very small cottages, with
walls of clay, or wood, or stone, according to the district
in which they happen to be. Long ago some squatter
built his little hut here, and out of pity, perhaps, or
through carelessness, the lord of the manor took no
notice. There he remained, year after year, until custom
allowed him to look upon it as his own; and in time
it actually became his private property. Such squatters
in lonely places were often looked upon more or less with
fear by the timid folk living in the distant village. They
did not care to do or say anything to upset the stranger,
fearing for the safety of their sheep, cattle, and poultry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Many little holdings and small farms began in this
way.</p>

<p>Many of the farms, though they were separate holdings,
still had strips in the big fields of the parish. The
crops were sown and gathered according to the ancient
customs, and the cattle turned into them and out on the
waste lands at certain seasons, just as they had been in
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>But about the beginning of the eighteenth century
there was a pretty general movement towards breaking
up these big fields into separate parts, and letting each
farmer have his portion to himself, so that he might
know exactly what land was his and what belonged to his
neighbour. So it came to pass that Enclosure Acts were
passed for parish after parish. The old common arable
fields were divided among those who had rights in them.
Then many of the old wastes, heaths, commons, and
marshes were treated in the same way.</p>

<p>That caused a great change in the appearance of the
parish. Instead of the fields in long, straight strips,
with unploughed balks between them, the strips belonging
to each farmer were thrown into one, and hedgerows
planted. In time they became smooth fields, separated
from each other by hedges, in which grew here and
there timber trees. The old cart-tracks, winding across
and round the common fields, in time became lanes
bounded by high hedges. The trackways across many
of the old wastes and commons in a similar way were
turned into lanes, and the waste broken up into fields.
Still, a good deal of the waste land was left, and has
never yet been enclosed. So far as we can see now, this
is not likely to happen, because we feel more and more
every year that, for the sake of the health and recreation
of the people, it is absolutely necessary to preserve as
many open spaces as possible. Some of these wastes
and uncultivated, or only partially cultivated, lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
have been brought under the spade and the plough
during the war-time, and all over the country people
have heartily set to work to increase our "homegrown"
food supply.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The fields, the hedgerows, and the lanes which delight
us so much in the country are, most of them, some two
hundred years old.</p>

<p>When the farm had its own separate fields allotted to
it, it became convenient for the farmer to live in the
midst of his land. So we find the farm-house and its
buildings, with a few labourers' cottages, a long way
out of the village, and away from the church. If you
take notice you will find that from this outlying farm-house
there is usually a pretty straight field-path to the
parish church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
good deal could be said about our forests and woodlands&mdash;their
importance, and the part they have played in
the making of England. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries especially, there was great attention
paid to the cultivation of trees, and many of the owners
of private park-lands did excellent work in promoting
the growth of timber. But in the nineteenth century
there seems to have been a considerable falling-off in
this respect, and far-seeing men at times warned us that
we needed to pay more attention to trees and forests and
to the growth of timber. The terrible blizzard which
swept over the country in March, 1916, brought down
thousands and thousands of fine old trees, and the needs
of our army and navy during the war-time has made
sad havoc in parks and plantations, so that one of the
urgent needs of the days in front of us is systematic
attention to "afforestation", in order to "make good"
the terrible wastage.</p>

<p>Hamlets have grown up away from the old village
green, its church, and its manor-house. The roads were
often so bad that horses frequently cast their shoes,
tires came off wheels, and wheels came off carts and
coaches; so under many "a spreading chestnut-tree"
a little smithy and wheel-wright's shop arose. A smithy
is always a centre of life and news, as everybody knows.
You can see to-day, along many of our roads, sheds and
shops being opened, where broken-down cycles and
motor-cars can be repaired and supplied with odds and
ends which they may happen to need. Round these
hamlets have in time sprung up, and in scores of places
the hamlet has become of more importance than the old
village, and has grown into a little town, with new
churches and chapels and public buildings.</p>

<p>In these war-years large numbers of quite new townships
of enormous size have sprung up in connection
with the making of munitions, and the provision of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
hospitals and camps, and as yet we know very little
about them as a whole. Some are only temporary, but
others have "come to stay", and in them new industries
on a big scale will probably be developed. All this
means change&mdash;change of appearance, change of ideas,
change of methods.</p>

<p>Then there are the districts where new industries and
manufactures have been planted. That is too large a
subject to deal with here, but think of the great changes
these have wrought on the face of the country in the
coal and mineral districts of England in the last two
hundred years!</p>

<p>Again, there are the railways. Notice how little
townships have grown up round the railway stations,
especially on the main lines in districts near a big town.
Houses spring up for the hosts of people who, like
streams of human ants, hurry to the station to catch the
early morning trains, and, as the afternoon wears into
evening, come again from the station to snatch a few
hours' rest at home.</p>

<p>We have said nothing of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"The beauty and mystery of ships,</div>
<div class="line i0h">And the magic of the sea",</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the part they have had in the making of our
towns and villages. This subject would require not
only one but many books, and then we shall only just
have begun to think about it, and to find out how little
we know. Our wonderful Navy, our Merchant Sailors,
our Fishermen&mdash;what do we <em>not</em> owe to them for what
they have done for us in the terribly anxious times
through which we have passed and are still passing!
It is good, in spite of all the awful suffering, to have
lived through these years, and to have seen something
of what can be done by sacrifice of self, co-operation,
and just "sticking to duty"&mdash;on land, on sea, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the sea, and in the air, in busy towns, and in quiet
country places.</p>

<p>Yes, the life of our towns and villages is a very
interesting subject. Nature and Man each works for
and with the other; both are full of mystery, life,
beauty, and high inspiration, if we could only use our
eyes to see, our intelligence to understand, our hearts to
sympathize, and our hands to work, for the things that
are true, and lovely, and pure.</p>
